The yearly renegotiation will give rivals \u2014 particularly those in the burgeoning generative AI field \u2014 a chance to compete for key placements.\\nMost Read from Bloomberg\\nWealthy County in New York Must Pay $112 Million Over Immigrant Rights Violations\\nTrump Replaces Architect to Lead $300 Million Ballroom Design\\nA Bright Idea for Road Safety: Traffic Light Timing\\nWealthy New Jersey Town\u2019s Vote on Fixing School Deficit Canceled\\nOwner of NYC\u2019s Fordham Landing Housing Project Files Bankruptcy\\nThe final judgment will still allow Google to offer its products to Apple Inc. for use in its popular iPhone and pay other electronics makers like Samsung Electronics Co. for default placement. But the judge said those contracts must be renegotiated annually.\\nMehta noted in his ruling that both Google and the US government said they could work with the one-year limitation on default contracts. As such, \u201cthe court holds that a hard-and-fast termination requirement after one year would best carry out the purpose of the injunctive relief.\u201d\\nGoogle and the Justice Department didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\\nFollowing a 10-week trial, Mehta found in August 2024 that Google illegally monopolized online search and search advertising markets. He then held a second trial in the spring of 2025 to consider the Justice Department\u2019s request that Google be forced to sell off its popular web browser, Chrome.\\nMehta rejected that request, ruling instead in September 2025 that Google must share some of the data underpinning its search results with rivals. Friday\u2019s decision expands on that ruling, outlining the specific circumstances in which the company must share its data and with whom.\\nIn the September decision, Mehta ruled that Google could no longer pay companies to exclusively use its Search, Chrome web browser or Google Play Store, though he declined to bar all payments outright. That ruling incorporated aspects of proposals from Google and the Justice Department, requiring him to issue a second one defining some of the decision\u2019s technical terms.\\nGoogle has said it plans to appeal Mehta\u2019s initial ruling that its contracts, which require companies like Apple and Samsung to make its search engine the default on browsers and phones, violate US antitrust law.

Just seven years later the maker of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is valued at a stunning $4.2 trillion, while five other technology companies now have market caps that exceed $2 trillion.\\nThis growth shows just how fast companies that are first to embrace a world-changing new technology -- in this case artificial intelligence -- can scale. I predict, however, that another, quite different technology will push the market cap of a company outside the tech sector above the $2 trillion level by 2028.\\nThe company I'm referring to is pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and the technology is one that everyone is familiar with by now -- the class of medications called GLP-1 agonists, which have proven extremely effective in lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss.\"}\n {'paragraph_number': 2, 'highlight': \"Eli Lilly now has the world's best-selling drug\", 'paragraph': \"In the third quarter, Eli Lilly's GLP-1 medication -- called tirzepatide, which treats both type 2 diabetes and obesity -- became the best-selling drug on the planet. In doing so, it knocked Keytruda, the cancer immunotherapy drug made by Merck, off the throne. Tirzepatide is sold as Mounjaro for treating type 2 diabetes and as Zepbound for weight loss.\\nSales of tirzepatide have pushed Eli Lilly's stock 633% higher over the past five years -- the bulk of that rapid rise has come since May 2022 when the company first started selling the drug for treatment of diabetes -- and 38% higher this year. For comparison, the S&P 500 index is up 87% over the past five years and 16% this year.\\nThat growth pushed Eli Lilly's market cap briefly above $1 trillion in November. The stock has settled back a bit since then, to around $953 billion. But I would argue that Eli Lilly's fortunes -- and those of its shareholders -- are very closely tied to the GLP-1 market. In the third quarter, sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound accounted for about $10.1 billion in revenue, or about 57% of the company's total revenue. In its third-quarter filing, Lilly said the two products were largely responsible for its 54% revenue growth.\"}\n {'paragraph_number': 3, 'highlight': 'Forecasts for the GLP-1 market are changing', 'paragraph': 'Forecasts for the GLP-1 market are all over the map at the moment. But one research firm expects it to grow from about $49 billion this year to more than $157 billion by 2035, which represents a compound annual growth rate of 11.1%.\\nYet several factors are causing some analysts to rethink those numbers, and even lower them. Chief among those are what analysts call \"price erosion.\" That is, declining prices per unit of medication.\\nAnd we\\'ve seen some of that up close in recent weeks, as both Lilly and GLP-1 competitor Novo Nordisk in November struck a deal with the Trump administration to dramatically lower the prices they charge Medicare patients for their obesity drugs.'}\n {'paragraph_number': 4, 'highlight': 'Other markets and ailments are emerging for GLP-1 drugs', 'paragraph': \"But I would argue that kind of thinking is myopic. First, consider that obesity has long been an epidemic of developed countries. Now, however, obesity is proliferating in other nations, including large emerging-market countries like China. Goldman Sachs, which recently dialed back its forecast for the GLP-1 market's growth due to expected price erosion, also increased its forecast for markets outside the U.S. As of 2020, half of all Chinese adults were overweight or obese. The Chinese government projects that will rise to 65% by 2030.\\nIn addition, the potential uses for GLP-1 drugs are rapidly increasing in number. The drugs are now being explored as treatments for addiction -- reducing cravings for everything from alcohol to gambling -- as well as osteoarthritis and Alzheimer's disease, among many other ailments. They're even being studied as a potential treatment for obesity in cats and other pets.\\nIf GLP-1 drugs can help with so many diseases and chronic conditions, the market for them is poised to explode much more dramatically than current forecasts allow. Eli Lilly is currently the leader in the GLP-1 drug market, and I see its share price and market cap benefiting from that growth in a big way.\"}\n {'paragraph_number': 5, 'highlight': 'Should you buy stock in Eli Lilly right now?', 'paragraph': \"Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:\\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Eli Lilly wasn\u2019t one of them.

The second is increased incorporation of AI software that's useful and works well with existing tech tools.\\nBoth of these ideas could define the next phase of AI, as companies strive to position themselves as leaders in an increasingly competitive AI landscape.

But even Nvidia seems to be a little nervous about Alphabet\\'s chip prospects. When the rumors of Meta\\'s potential Alphabet chip purchase surfaced, the company posted on X that it was \"delighted by Google\\'s success\" but added, \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry -- it\\'s the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"\\nThe timing of Nvidia\\'s post and the company reminding everyone that it\\'s far more advanced than the competition comes across as a little nervous.\\nAnd perhaps it should be. Analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that if Alphabet were to begin selling its TPUs, it could sell 500,000 to 1 million of them by 2027.

In Pursuit of Glory: One Woman's Rise To The Top In A Male-Dominated Field is an intimate, unflinching account of what it takes for a woman to succeed-and stay true to herself-in environments where she is often the only woman in the room.\\nGrounded in vivid storytelling and real-world insights, the book pulls readers directly into Jewitt's early years in industrial construction-a chapter that included time in remote work camps as well as demanding project sites where sexism, harassment, dangerous conditions, and constant scrutiny were a part of the work. These experiences influenced the way she later led teams and navigated roles across global corporate organizations. Yet her journey is not just about survival. It's about transformation-developing resilience, finding her voice, rejecting toxic relationships, and redefining what leadership looks like in male-dominated industries.\\nThrough raw honesty and sharp clarity, Jewitt illustrates the psychological toll of being underestimated, objectified, and dismissed, even as she continued to rise into larger spheres of leadership. Her journey moves from her early years as a scaffold laborer to global vice president at just thirty-five, to leading large-scale operations at Amazon, and ultimately steering EHS across Google's worldwide data centers. Her firsthand accounts of confrontation, boundary-setting, and self-advocacy provide a compelling roadmap for women who feel overlooked or undervalued in their own careers.\\nBut In Pursuit of Glory is not solely a professional narrative. It also explores the deeply personal moments that shaped her-complex family dynamics, formative relationships, painful lessons in self-worth, and the emotional cost of pushing through adversity. Jewitt pulls back the curtain on the sacrifices and self-discovery that accompany ambition, revealing how she learned to trust her intuition, recognize red flags, and reclaim her power along the way.\\nToday, as the global leader responsible for EHS across Google's worldwide data centers, Jewitt's story arrives at a moment when conversations about gender equity, workplace safety, and inclusive leadership are more urgent than ever. Her memoir speaks directly to mid-career women seeking clarity, confidence, and growth; to leaders striving to build cultures of respect; and to anyone who has ever questioned whether they belong in the room they've worked hard to enter.\\nIn Pursuit of Glory is both a wake-up call and an invitation-a reminder that authentic leadership is built through courage, self-awareness, and the willingness to rise after every setback. Jewitt's journey proves that even in the toughest environments, women can lead, excel, and reshape the systems around them.\\nIn Pursuit of Glory is available now on Amazon and at major online retailers.
