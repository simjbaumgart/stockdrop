    "Catalyst Identified: The -7.25% drop is driven by credible reports of Luckin Coffee considering an acquisition of Blue Bottle Coffee (and potentially other assets), which investors view as a risky strategic pivot away from its core low-cost model.",
    "Technical Breakdown: The stock has violated the critical 200-day SMA ($35.98) on elevated volume, signaling institutional distribution. While the RSI (24-28) is oversold, the 'band-crash' pattern suggests momentum is still strongly bearish.",
    "Fundamental Context: Luckin remains the dominant operator in China (29k+ stores), outpacing Starbucks and Cotti. However, the potential capital allocation toward 'premium' assets introduces execution risk that outweighs current operational success in the short term."
