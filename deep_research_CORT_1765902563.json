    "The -6.70% drop was triggered by a UBS 'Neutral' initiation (valuation call), not a fundamental deterioration, creating a 'sell-the-news' reaction.",
    "Technical support held firmly at the 50-day SMA ($78.27) with low relative volume (0.75), indicating a lack of institutional conviction in the sell-off.",
    "The December 30, 2025 PDUFA for relacorilant is a massive positive catalyst; clinical data (GRACE trial) strongly supports approval, which would offset risks from generic Korlym erosion.",
    "Structural risks (Teva generic launch, Medicare formulary losses) are real but are slow-moving compared to the immediate binary upside of the PDUFA decision."
