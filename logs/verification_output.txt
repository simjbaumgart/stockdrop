    [THESIS]: The -8.5% sell-off is **statistically justified and potentially insufficient** given the valuation compression risk. TSLA is currently priced for perfection (Forward PE >190x) assuming >35% EPS growth. Contraction of margins to 15% and a 5% delivery miss threatens to decouple the stock from its "hyper-growth" premium, potentially compressing the multiple closer to the industry average over time.
