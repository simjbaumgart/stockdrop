Stay tuned for more special editions of WSB this week!</span><br><br><span class="b">Interest rates:</span> The Federal Reserve was not in a rush to tinker with monetary policy to start the year, and that outlook continued up until September. The central bank was <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795394-waiting-for-more-clarity">waiting for more clarity</a>, trusting in the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805935-optimal-speed-for-the-federal-reserve">solid U.S. economy and low unemployment rate</a>, as well as worrying about inflation. That all changed towards the end of the year amid concerns <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821389-rate-cuts-are-coming-the-question-is-how-much">over the labor market</a>, with the FOMC cutting rates at each of its last three meetings of 2025.<br><br><span class="b">More on the Fed:</span> Calling him "Mr. Too Late," President Trump lashed out at Fed Chair Powell since taking office in a bid to lower interest rates. He also threatened to fire him on multiple occasions, though many legalists wrangled <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4432446-trump-vs-powell-fed-board-chair-isnt-guaranteed-to-be-fomc-chair">over if and how he could have the authority</a>. Trump also <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816717-cook-firing-might-be-a-warning-to-powell">attempted to fire Governor Lisa Cook</a> over mortgage fraud in a case that is still ongoing, while he replaced Adriana Kugler <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4481727-trump-set-to-nominate-adviser-miran-for-4-month-fed-governor-term---report">with Stephen Miran</a>, meaning he will soon have nominated a majority of the Fed board (including Bowman and Waller).<br><br><span class="b">Biting the dust:</span> Once worth $6B in 2021, 23andMe (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ME#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link" title="23andMe Holding Co.">ME</a>) filed for <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4769895-the-unraveling-of-dna-company-23andme">bankruptcy protection</a>, marking one of the last SPAC mergers that rode the trading boom of the post-COVID era - only to later go bust. It was also a reminder that investors this year put a strong focus on profits, earnings, and tangible results. Other notable bankruptcies in 2025 included Nikola, Luminar and Spirit Airlines, as well as Rite Aid, Jo-Ann Stores, Forever 21 and Claire\'s.<br><br><span class="b">Oil slick:</span> Starting the year in the $70s, the price of oil quickly slipped, ending the year in the $50s. A promise by President Trump to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4759157-has-the-u-s-cracked-the-opec-cartel">"drill, baby, drill"</a> continued to see America produce more crude than any country on record, while the threat of tariffs on global growth weighed on prices. Many big countries like China and India also got their crude from shadow fleets, while OPEC+ reversed its production cuts and members pumped more than their official quotas.<br><br><span class="b">Buildup in the Caribbean:</span> Speaking of oil, the U.S. intensified its pressure on Venezuela by seizing two tankers and ordering a "total and complete" blockade of sanctioned ships entering and leaving the country. Discounts for Venezuelan crude widened significantly, reflecting the rising cost of a "war clause" requested by shipowners. However, Chevron (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX" title="Chevron Corporation">CVX</a>) continues to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853956-u-s-intensifies-pressure-on-venezuela">operate there under an American exemption</a>, with its flows uninterrupted by Operation Southern Spear.<br><br><span class="b">Supercharged award:</span> In a vote that turned many heads, Tesla (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA" title="Tesla, Inc.">TSLA</a>) shareholders approved a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4517833-tesla-shareholders-vote-in-favor-of-ceo-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation">record $1 trillion pay package</a> for CEO Elon Musk. The compensation was tied to various milestones, including the delivery of 20M Tesla vehicles, 1M robotaxis, 1M Optimus robots, and growing Tesla\'s market cap to $8.5T over the next decade. A lot of shareholders spoke out before the big vote, including both those <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4837292-how-about-a-1-trillion-pay-package">in the "For" and "Against" camps</a>. <br><br><span class="b">Deal for TikTok:</span> An agreement was finally signed for the app regularly used by more than 170M Americans. TikTok divested its U.S. entity, likely valued at $14B, to a joint venture that will be <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854612-oracle-wins-big-in-new-tiktok-deal">controlled by American investors and companies</a>. User data will be stored locally in a system run by Oracle (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL" title="Oracle Corporation">ORCL</a>), which will serve as the "trusted security partner" for auditing and validating compliance, as well as providing a "trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States."<br><br><span class="b">BTC bears:</span> Crypto was volatile as usual this year, but after all was traded and done, Bitcoin (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD" title="Bitcoin USD">BTC-USD</a>) ended 2025 with a net loss. That\'s despite some high-profile announcements like the creation of the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766069-full-story-of-strategic-bitcoin-reserve">U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</a>. Some were <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844957-bitcoin-wipes-out-gains-for-2025">nervous about catching a falling knife</a>, especially with increased outflows, liquidations, and profit taking, but alternative assets were shining bright elsewhere.<br><br><span class="b">Meet the metals:</span> Glittery objects were an investor favorite, including gold and silver. Outsized rallies ensued as <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828484-all-that-glitters-is-gold">safe-haven demand continued to grow</a> amid mounting economic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as rising expectations of Federal Reserve easing and aggressive central bank buying. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855865-silver-tops-75-as-precious-metals-power-on">Industrial demand</a> and institutional capitulation were also said to be at play, though there might be some FOMO going on in the background.<br><br><span class="b">Hollywood giants:</span> A new content and entertainment powerhouse emerged as Netflix (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX" title="Netflix, Inc.">NFLX</a>) announced an <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851128-netflix-might-soon-be-the-ultimate-content-creator">$82.7B deal</a> for Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD" title="Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.">WBD</a>). The deal included the streaming and movie studio part of the business, while cable networks like CNN and TNT will be spun off into a standalone company in 2026. Rival Paramount (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY" title="Paramount Skydance Corporation">PSKY</a>), which was also involved in the bidding war (and merged with David Ellison\'s Skydance Media <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804420-paramount-and-skydance-get-the-green-light">earlier this year</a>), did not take things lightly, going hostile <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20331968-paramount-goes-hostile-in-bid-for-warner-bros-challenging-a-72-billion-offer-by-netflix">with a $108B takeover offer</a>.</p> <p class="wsb_bold">Here\'s the latest Seeking Alpha analysis</p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855848-these-are-some-of-my-favorite-investment-picks-for-2026" target="_blank"> These Are Some Of My Favorite Investment Picks For 2026 </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855470-nebius-nvidia-lead-the-best-ai-stocks-to-hold" target="_blank"> Nebius, Nvidia Lead The Best AI Stocks To Hold </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855955-2026-market-outlook-energy-will-lead-the-way-down" target="_blank">QQQI: This Popular 13% Yield Looks Perfect - Until You Dig Into The Details </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855753-amazons-stock-is-dirt-cheap" target="_blank"> Amazon\'s Stock Is Dirt Cheap</a><br><br><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855955-2026-market-outlook-energy-will-lead-the-way-down" target="_blank">2026 Market Outlook: Energy Will Lead The Way Down </a></p> <p class="wsb_bold">What else is happening...</p> <p>Reddit (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT" title="Reddit, Inc.">RDDT</a>) to benefit from rising popularity of AI summaries - <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535672-reddit-to-benefit-from-rising-popularity-of-ai-summaries-in-web-searches---needham">Needham</a>.<br><br>Buy the dip: Michael Saylor\'s Strategy (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR" title="Strategy Inc">MSTR</a>) scoops up <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535686-strategy-buys-109m-worth-of-bitcoin-during-holiday-week">more BTC</a>.<br><br><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20350088-trump-says-the-us-hit-a-facility-along-shore-where-he-says-alleged-drug-boats-load-up">U.S. strikes a dock facility</a> in latest pressure campaign on Venezuela.<br><br>Protests erupt in Iran as rial hits record low and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20349507-protests-erupt-in-iran-over-currencys-plunge-to-record-low">central bank head resigns</a>.<br><br>The Costco (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST" title="Costco Wholesale Corporation">COST</a>) model is working for Sam\'s Club (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT" title="Walmart Inc.">WMT</a>) <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535651-the-costco-model-is-working-for-sams-club-in-china">in China</a>.<br><br>Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest loads up on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535609-cathie-wood-invests-heavily-in-gene-editing-companies-offloads-30-million-worth-tesla-stock">gene-editing companies</a>.<br><br>That\'s all folks: Citi (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C" title="Citigroup Inc.">C</a>) to sell remaining <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535743-citi-to-sell-remaining-russian-operations">Russian operations</a>.<br><br>India seeks $30B from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP" title="BP p.l.c.">BP</a>, Reliance Industries in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535730-india-seeks-30b-from-bp-reliance-industries-in-gas-production-dispute-reuters">gas production dispute</a>.<br><br>Boeing (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA" title="The Boeing Company">BA</a>) scores $8.6B contract to build aircraft for <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535756-boeing-scores-8_6b-contract-to-build-aircraft-for-israel-air-force">Israeli Air Force</a>.<br><br>SA Asks: Would SpaceX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPACE" title="SpaceX">SPACE</a>) stock be a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535587-sa-asks-would-spacex-stock-be-a-good-investment">good investment?</a></p> <p class="wsb_bold">Today\'s Markets</p> <p><b>In Asia,</b> Japan <span class="red">-0.4%</span>.

The central bank was <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795394-waiting-for-more-clarity">waiting for more clarity</a>, trusting in the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805935-optimal-speed-for-the-federal-reserve">solid U.S. economy and low unemployment rate</a>, as well as worrying about inflation. That all changed towards the end of the year amid concerns <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821389-rate-cuts-are-coming-the-question-is-how-much">over the labor market</a>, with the FOMC cutting rates at each of its last three meetings of 2025.<br><br><span class="b">More on the Fed:</span> Calling him "Mr. Too Late," President Trump lashed out at Fed Chair Powell since taking office in a bid to lower interest rates. He also threatened to fire him on multiple occasions, though many legalists wrangled <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4432446-trump-vs-powell-fed-board-chair-isnt-guaranteed-to-be-fomc-chair">over if and how he could have the authority</a>. Trump also <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816717-cook-firing-might-be-a-warning-to-powell">attempted to fire Governor Lisa Cook</a> over mortgage fraud in a case that is still ongoing, while he replaced Adriana Kugler <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4481727-trump-set-to-nominate-adviser-miran-for-4-month-fed-governor-term---report">with Stephen Miran</a>, meaning he will soon have nominated a majority of the Fed board (including Bowman and Waller).<br><br><span class="b">Biting the dust:</span> Once worth $6B in 2021, 23andMe (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ME#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link" title="23andMe Holding Co.">ME</a>) filed for <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4769895-the-unraveling-of-dna-company-23andme">bankruptcy protection</a>, marking one of the last SPAC mergers that rode the trading boom of the post-COVID era - only to later go bust. It was also a reminder that investors this year put a strong focus on profits, earnings, and tangible results. Other notable bankruptcies in 2025 included Nikola, Luminar and Spirit Airlines, as well as Rite Aid, Jo-Ann Stores, Forever 21 and Claire\'s.<br><br><span class="b">Oil slick:</span> Starting the year in the $70s, the price of oil quickly slipped, ending the year in the $50s. A promise by President Trump to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4759157-has-the-u-s-cracked-the-opec-cartel">"drill, baby, drill"</a> continued to see America produce more crude than any country on record, while the threat of tariffs on global growth weighed on prices. Many big countries like China and India also got their crude from shadow fleets, while OPEC+ reversed its production cuts and members pumped more than their official quotas.<br><br><span class="b">Buildup in the Caribbean:</span> Speaking of oil, the U.S. intensified its pressure on Venezuela by seizing two tankers and ordering a "total and complete" blockade of sanctioned ships entering and leaving the country. Discounts for Venezuelan crude widened significantly, reflecting the rising cost of a "war clause" requested by shipowners. However, Chevron (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX" title="Chevron Corporation">CVX</a>) continues to <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853956-u-s-intensifies-pressure-on-venezuela">operate there under an American exemption</a>, with its flows uninterrupted by Operation Southern Spear.<br><br><span class="b">Supercharged award:</span> In a vote that turned many heads, Tesla (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA" title="Tesla, Inc.">TSLA</a>) shareholders approved a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4517833-tesla-shareholders-vote-in-favor-of-ceo-elon-musks-1-trillion-compensation">record $1 trillion pay package</a> for CEO Elon Musk. The compensation was tied to various milestones, including the delivery of 20M Tesla vehicles, 1M robotaxis, 1M Optimus robots, and growing Tesla\'s market cap to $8.5T over the next decade. A lot of shareholders spoke out before the big vote, including both those <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4837292-how-about-a-1-trillion-pay-package">in the "For" and "Against" camps</a>. <br><br><span class="b">Deal for TikTok:</span> An agreement was finally signed for the app regularly used by more than 170M Americans. TikTok divested its U.S. entity, likely valued at $14B, to a joint venture that will be <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854612-oracle-wins-big-in-new-tiktok-deal">controlled by American investors and companies</a>. User data will be stored locally in a system run by Oracle (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL" title="Oracle Corporation">ORCL</a>), which will serve as the "trusted security partner" for auditing and validating compliance, as well as providing a "trusted and secure cloud environment in the United States."<br><br><span class="b">BTC bears:</span> Crypto was volatile as usual this year, but after all was traded and done, Bitcoin (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD" title="Bitcoin USD">BTC-USD</a>) ended 2025 with a net loss. That\'s despite some high-profile announcements like the creation of the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766069-full-story-of-strategic-bitcoin-reserve">U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve</a>. Some were <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844957-bitcoin-wipes-out-gains-for-2025">nervous about catching a falling knife</a>, especially with increased outflows, liquidations, and profit taking, but alternative assets were shining bright elsewhere.<br><br><span class="b">Meet the metals:</span> Glittery objects were an investor favorite, including gold and silver. Outsized rallies ensued as <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828484-all-that-glitters-is-gold">safe-haven demand continued to grow</a> amid mounting economic and geopolitical uncertainties, as well as rising expectations of Federal Reserve easing and aggressive central bank buying. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855865-silver-tops-75-as-precious-metals-power-on">Industrial demand</a> and institutional capitulation were also said to be at play, though there might be some FOMO going on in the background.<br><br><span class="b">Hollywood giants:</span> A new content and entertainment powerhouse emerged as Netflix (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX" title="Netflix, Inc.">NFLX</a>) announced an <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851128-netflix-might-soon-be-the-ultimate-content-creator">$82.7B deal</a> for Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD" title="Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.">WBD</a>). The deal included the streaming and movie studio part of the business, while cable networks like CNN and TNT will be spun off into a standalone company in 2026. Rival Paramount (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY" title="Paramount Skydance Corporation">PSKY</a>), which was also involved in the bidding war (and merged with David Ellison\'s Skydance Media <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804420-paramount-and-skydance-get-the-green-light">earlier this year</a>), did not take things lightly, going hostile <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20331968-paramount-goes-hostile-in-bid-for-warner-bros-challenging-a-72-billion-offer-by-netflix">with a $108B takeover offer</a>.</p> <p class="wsb_bold">Here\'s the latest Seeking Alpha analysis</p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855848-these-are-some-of-my-favorite-investment-picks-for-2026" target="_blank"> These Are Some Of My Favorite Investment Picks For 2026 </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855470-nebius-nvidia-lead-the-best-ai-stocks-to-hold" target="_blank"> Nebius, Nvidia Lead The Best AI Stocks To Hold </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855955-2026-market-outlook-energy-will-lead-the-way-down" target="_blank">QQQI: This Popular 13% Yield Looks Perfect - Until You Dig Into The Details </a></p> <p><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855753-amazons-stock-is-dirt-cheap" target="_blank"> Amazon\'s Stock Is Dirt Cheap</a><br><br><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855955-2026-market-outlook-energy-will-lead-the-way-down" target="_blank">2026 Market Outlook: Energy Will Lead The Way Down </a></p> <p class="wsb_bold">What else is happening...</p> <p>Reddit (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RDDT" title="Reddit, Inc.">RDDT</a>) to benefit from rising popularity of AI summaries - <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535672-reddit-to-benefit-from-rising-popularity-of-ai-summaries-in-web-searches---needham">Needham</a>.<br><br>Buy the dip: Michael Saylor\'s Strategy (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR" title="Strategy Inc">MSTR</a>) scoops up <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535686-strategy-buys-109m-worth-of-bitcoin-during-holiday-week">more BTC</a>.<br><br><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20350088-trump-says-the-us-hit-a-facility-along-shore-where-he-says-alleged-drug-boats-load-up">U.S. strikes a dock facility</a> in latest pressure campaign on Venezuela.<br><br>Protests erupt in Iran as rial hits record low and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20349507-protests-erupt-in-iran-over-currencys-plunge-to-record-low">central bank head resigns</a>.<br><br>The Costco (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST" title="Costco Wholesale Corporation">COST</a>) model is working for Sam\'s Club (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT" title="Walmart Inc.">WMT</a>) <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535651-the-costco-model-is-working-for-sams-club-in-china">in China</a>.<br><br>Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest loads up on <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535609-cathie-wood-invests-heavily-in-gene-editing-companies-offloads-30-million-worth-tesla-stock">gene-editing companies</a>.<br><br>That\'s all folks: Citi (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C" title="Citigroup Inc.">C</a>) to sell remaining <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535743-citi-to-sell-remaining-russian-operations">Russian operations</a>.<br><br>India seeks $30B from <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP" title="BP p.l.c.">BP</a>, Reliance Industries in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535730-india-seeks-30b-from-bp-reliance-industries-in-gas-production-dispute-reuters">gas production dispute</a>.<br><br>Boeing (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA" title="The Boeing Company">BA</a>) scores $8.6B contract to build aircraft for <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535756-boeing-scores-8_6b-contract-to-build-aircraft-for-israel-air-force">Israeli Air Force</a>.<br><br>SA Asks: Would SpaceX (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPACE" title="SpaceX">SPACE</a>) stock be a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/4535587-sa-asks-would-spacex-stock-be-a-good-investment">good investment?</a></p> <p class="wsb_bold">Today\'s Markets</p> <p><b>In Asia,</b> Japan <span class="red">-0.4%</span>.
