The company managed to achieve high single-digit YoY revenue growth, incredible given its scale, and it did that with total cost of sales at only $54 billion. That means roughly 52% of the company's revenue is cost of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's incredibly impressive for a primarily hardware company. At the same time, unlike other tech companies, Apple has comfortably managed investing in artificial intelligence, without blowing out any semblance of a budget. The company's R&amp;D expenses have expanded by combined with G&amp;A the segment is still at less than $16 billion / year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The net result is after paying taxes, Apple had net income of $27.5 billion. That's more than $100 billion in annualized net income for the giant, net income that it continues to rapidly grow. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Platform Dominance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, those who're afraid of the impact of artificial intelligence would do well to note Apple's status as a platform. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1624\" data-height=\"688\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Apple App Charts\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"271\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518638645403_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Apple App Charts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top free iPhone app is currently ChatGPT.

The same through coding tools like Claude AI etc. which are being run on the same laptops programmers were already using.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is key in our view, because offloading compute for tasks to large language models, or LLMs, could potentially even reduce people's needs for beefy local compute enabling them to shift from Desktops to personal computing such as Laptops. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Segment Breakdown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a segment perspective, the Apple thesis remains strong with great performance across the board. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1506\" data-height=\"624\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Apple Press Release\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/34591885-17659518983010604_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Apple Press Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company only saw revenue decline in the Greater China, where Apple is facing strong domestic competition. However, even here, the company's revenue decline was in the low single-digits. Everywhere outside of the market where there's concerted effort to limit the company in favor of domestic alternatives is seeing high single-digit to double-digit growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple is seeing strength in categories as well. While the iPad and Wearables categories remained flat, the company saw strong iPhone and Mac growth, the core categories that lead to follow-on growth with other categories. Apple's services business also remained incredibly strong. This is another sign of Apple's strength. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple Shareholder Return Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since starting its shareholder return program, Apple managed to reducing its outstanding shares by 43%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1580\" data-height=\"710\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Macrotrends\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/24/34591885-17665575916547306_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macrotrends</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple has spent more than <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apples-704-billion-decade-long-213225306.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKXNxfFl8G7lU9hdnEQxqconS02yzQ5SEU4Q4RFKYE1SQtiQvmaDh67so0zwqunhCA-m8qpI7D54d99aZLAvapsC1pX_M71C1zevrraKyHceNDo0KQnZPAasIqwSuvylqIcidKxtXOenqCxUgQ1TWl9DqFcIwMZm-eXgOzN8t8zY\" rel=\"nofollow\">$700 billion to purchase these shares</a>, or $64 / share. That's a quarter of current prices. Apple recently announced an <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-nasdaqgs-aapl-announces-100-172903679.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKXNxfFl8G7lU9hdnEQxqconS02yzQ5SEU4Q4RFKYE1SQtiQvmaDh67so0zwqunhCA-m8qpI7D54d99aZLAvapsC1pX_M71C1zevrraKyHceNDo0KQnZPAasIqwSuvylqIcidKxtXOenqCxUgQ1TWl9DqFcIwMZm-eXgOzN8t8zY\" rel=\"nofollow\">extra $100 billion buyback</a> after a $110 billion buyback last year. The company has a very modest dividend of &lt;0.4%, but with buybacks total shareholder returns are roughly 3% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's modest, but for a company growing at the high single-digits, it's still very respectable. The company's growth will enable increasing buybacks and shareholder returns and enable the company to expand into its P/E of ~30x that goes virtually entirely to shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The largest risk to our thesis is Apple's valuation. Apple is sitting right at a $4 trillion market capitalization, with $112 billion in TTM net income. That puts the company at a P/E of ~30x. In a difficult market, Apple needs continued net income growth to justify its valuation, and whether or not that happens remains to be seen.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apple is one of the largest companies in the world with a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company has managed to shrink its shares outstanding by almost 50% over the past 13 years and it's focused on continuing to improve that. The company is spending almost $10 billion per month on share repurchases an indication of its massive scale. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is achieving high single-digit growth with strength on every segment of its platform. In addition, the company is the core platform that people are using for their AI usage, whether through ChatGPT or AI coding. Going forward, this makes Apple a valuable long-term investment.
