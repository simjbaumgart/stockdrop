The Irvine, California-based Masimo, which develops non-invasive health monitoring technologies, alleged that these Apple Watches \"infringed Masimo's patents related to light-based pulse oximetry technology.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. International Trade Commission issued a Limited Exclusion Order back in October 2023 to protect Masimo's patented technology.
