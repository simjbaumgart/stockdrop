The president also rolled out a $1 million \u201cgold card\u201d visa as a pathway to <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</span> citizenship for wealthy individuals.</p>\n  <p>A press release announcing the new rule says it is \u201cin line with other key changes the administration has made, such as the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/restriction-on-entry-of-certain-nonimmigrant-workers/\">Presidential Proclamation</a> that requires employers to pay an additional $100,000 per visa as a condition of eligibility.\u201d</p>\n  <p>Historically, H-1B visas have been awarded through a lottery system. This year, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\">AMZN</a>) was by far the top recipient, with more than 10,000 visas approved, followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\">MSFT</a>), Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">AAPL</a>) and Google. <span class=\"location\" value=\"LS/us.ca\">California</span> has the highest concentration of H-1B workers.</p>\n  <p>The new system will \u201cimplement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid\u201d foreign workers, according to Tuesday\u2019s press release. It will go into effect Feb. 27, 2026, and will apply to the upcoming H-1B cap registration season. </p>\n  <p>Supporters of the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-visa-h1b-rural-doctors-teachers-3a63095d603e405d08c496eb264d6100\">H-1B program</a> say it is an important pathway to hiring healthcare workers and educators. They say it drives innovation and economic growth in the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</span> and allows employers to fill jobs in specialized fields.</p>\n  <p>Critics argue that the visas often go to entry-level positions rather than senior roles requiring specialized skills. While the program is intended to prevent wage suppression or the displacement of <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</span> workers, critics say companies can pay lower wages by classifying jobs at the lowest skill levels, even when the workers hired have more experience.</p>\n  <p>The number of new visas issued annually is capped at 65,000, plus an additional 20,000 for people with a master\u2019s degree or higher. </p>\n  \nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.
