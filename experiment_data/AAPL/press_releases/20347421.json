While the feature was designed to tighten up privacy, it faced criticism from Big Tech rivals that it would make it harder for smaller apps to survive without charging consumers.</p>\n  <p>The authority didn\u2019t criticize the policy per se, but the fact that the Apple system requires third-party app makers to ask users for consent twice in order to comply with Europe\u2019s strict privacy rules.</p>\n  <p>\u201cAs a result, such double consent requirement is harmful to developers, whose business model relies on the sale of advertising space, as well as to advertisers and advertising intermediation platforms,\u201d the authority said.</p>\n  <p>The authority said that the double consent required was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d to the stated goal of data protection.</p>\n  <p>The finding is similar to one by the French antitrust watchdog, which in March fined Apple 150 million euros ($162 million) over the consent feature.</p>\n  <p>Apple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2023, when Italy\u2019s antitrust authority announced its investigation, the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LU/us.ca.cupino\">Cupertino, Calif.</span>-based company <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/italy-antitrust-apple-apps-2908125fb7963d75dfb21ef802156867\">defended its framework</a> and said it would engage with the Italian antitrust authority to address its questions.</p>\n  \nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.
