class=\"person\" value=\"\">Mike Smith</span>, Lamb Weston president and CEO. \u201cWe delivered robust volume growth and gained share in priority markets and key categories, demonstrating Lamb Weston\u2019s commitment to deliver quality, innovation, and value. Our team is executing at a high level, and we remain on track to achieve our $100 million cost savings program target for fiscal 2026. In addition, the board approved a 3 percent increase to the quarterly dividend, which has increased each year since Lamb Weston went public.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\nQ2 2026 Commentary\n</p>\n<p>\nQ2 Results of Operations\n</p>\n<p>\nNet sales increased $17.2 million, to $1,618.1 million versus the prior year quarter, and included a favorable foreign currency impact of $24.4 million. Net sales at constant currency<sup>(2)</sup> was essentially flat, as an 8 percent increase in volume was offset by an 8 percent decline in price/mix. Volume growth was driven by customer wins, share gains and retention, particularly in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</span> and <span class=\"location\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</span>. The decline in price/mix reflects the ongoing support of customers through price and trade, including the carryover impact of fiscal 2025 pricing, in a competitive global market environment.\n</p>\n<p>\nGross profit increased $46.5 million versus the prior year quarter to $324.3 million. Adjusted Gross Profit<sup>(1)</sup> declined $15.6 million to $327.9 million, primarily due to unfavorable price/mix. Total manufacturing cost per pound was lower, reflecting the benefits from cost savings initiatives and improved operating efficiencies in the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</span> segment. These initiatives more than offset inflationary pressures in key input categories other than raw product and higher manufacturing costs per pound in the International segment due to less favorable operating conditions and elevated production expenses.\n</p>\n<p>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\u201cSG&amp;A\u201d) declined $13.7 million versus the prior year quarter to $171.0 million. Adjusted SG&amp;A<sup>(1)</sup> declined $7.8 million versus the prior year quarter to $145.1 million, reflecting the benefits of ongoing cost savings initiatives, partially offset by compensation and benefits accruals.\n</p>\n<p>\nNet income increased to $62.1 million from a prior year quarter net loss of $36.1 million. Diluted EPS increased to $0.44 versus a prior year quarter diluted loss per share of $0.25. Adjusted Net Income<sup>(1)</sup> declined $8.2 million over the prior year quarter to $96.7 million, and Adjusted Diluted EPS<sup>(1)</sup> declined $0.04 from the prior year quarter to $0.69. The decline in Adjusted Net Income<sup>(1)</sup> and Adjusted Diluted EPS<sup>(1)</sup> largely reflects the lower Adjusted Gross Profit<sup>(1)</sup>, partially offset by lower Adjusted SG&amp;A<sup>(1)</sup>.\n</p>\n<p>\nAdjusted EBITDA<sup>(1)</sup> declined $8.5 million from the prior year quarter to $285.7 million. Lower Adjusted Gross Profit<sup>(1)</sup> and Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings were partially offset by lower Adjusted SG&amp;A<sup>(1)</sup>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Company\u2019s effective tax rate<sup>(3)</sup> in the second quarter of 2026 was 36.7 percent, versus (59.0) percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The results in both periods reflect the impact of items outlined in the Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the tables accompanying this press release. In addition, the Company recorded $14.4 million of discrete tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, primarily related to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against certain international deferred tax assets. Excluding these items, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate<sup>(3)</sup> was 31.8 percent in the second quarter of 2026, versus 24.7 percent in the prior year quarter. Compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025, the effective tax rate excluding the impact of these items is higher primarily due to having a larger proportion of losses in certain jurisdictions with no expected tax benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\nQ2 2026 Segment Highlights\n</p>\n<p>\nNorth America Summary\n</p>\n<p>\nNet sales for the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</span> segment, which includes all sales to customers in the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</span>, <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/ca\">Canada</span> and <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/mx\">Mexico</span>, was essentially flat at $1,069.5 million compared to the prior year quarter. Volume increased 8 percent, driven by recent customer contract wins, share gains and growth across channels. In response, the Company has restarted its curtailed North American production lines. Price/mix declined 8 percent, driven by the ongoing support of customers through price and trade, including the carryover impact from fiscal 2025 pricing, and an unfavorable mix.\n</p>\n<p>\nNorth America Segment Adjusted EBITDA increased $18.6 million to $287.8 million compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher volumes, lower manufacturing costs per pound, and lower Adjusted SG&amp;A<sup>(1)</sup>, reflecting benefits from cost savings initiatives, including operating efficiencies. These gains were partially offset by continued price and trade support for customers.\n</p>\n<p>\nInternational Summary\n</p>\n<p>\nNet sales for the International segment, which includes all sales to customers outside of <span class=\"location\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</span>, increased 4 percent, or $19.8 million, to $548.6 million compared to the prior year quarter, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $22.6 million. Net sales at constant currency<sup>(2)</sup> declined 1 percent. Volume increased 7 percent, driven by growth in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LR/asp\">Asia</span> and with multinational chain customers. Price/mix at constant currency<sup>(2)</sup> declined 8 percent, reflecting ongoing price and trade to support customers in a continued competitive environment as well as an unfavorable mix.\n</p>\n<p>\nInternational Segment Adjusted EBITDA declined $21.4 million to $27.2 million compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily attributable to higher manufacturing costs per pound, including increased fixed factory burden costs resulting from lower utilization of international production facilities and start-up expenses associated with the new production facility in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/ar\">Argentina</span>. These higher manufacturing costs were partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives and higher sales volume.\n</p>\n<p>\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\n</p>\n<p>\nEquity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures were $3.2 million and $2.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings<sup>(1)</sup> was $3.2 million and $11.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and 2025, respectively. The decline of $7.9 million in earnings was primarily the result of lower production volume and an unfavorable mix of sales. The results for the current and prior-year quarters reflect earnings associated with the Company\u2019s 50 percent interest in Lamb Weston/RDO Frozen, an unconsolidated potato processing joint venture in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LS/us.mn\">Minnesota</span>.\n</p>\n<p>\nCash Flows, Capital Expenditures and Liquidity\n</p>\n<p>\nDuring the first half of fiscal 2026, net cash provided by operating activities increased $101.1 million to $530.4 million compared to the prior year, primarily driven by $53.7 million of favorable working capital changes, led by lower inventories in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LB/nam\">North America</span> and a $47.4 million increase in net income, adjusted for non-cash items.\n</p>\n<p>\nCapital expenditures were $155.7 million during the first half of fiscal 2026, down $330.7 million from the prior year period. The decrease reflects the completion of major growth investments during fiscal 2025 and early fiscal 2026.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs of November 23, 2025, the Company had $82.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, with $1.35 billion of available liquidity under its revolving credit facility.\n</p>\n<p>\nCapital Returned to Shareholders\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2026, the Company returned $51.6 million to shareholders through cash dividends and repurchased $39.6 million of common stock under its share repurchase program, consisting of 617,623 shares at an average price of $64.18 per share. Approximately $308 million remains authorized and available for repurchase under the share repurchase program.\n</p>\n<p>\nOn December 17, 2025, the Board of Directors authorized a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend, or $0.01, to $0.38 per share of Lamb Weston common stock. The dividend is payable on February 27, 2026 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 30, 2026.\n</p>\n<p>\nFiscal 2026 Outlook\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Company reaffirmed its financial targets for fiscal 2026 as follows:\n</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\nFiscal 2026 Guidance\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n<span class=\"person\" value=\"\">Net Sales</span>\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n$6.35 billion to $6.55 billion\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\nAdjusted EBITDA\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n$1.00 billion to $1.20 billion\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\nCash Used for Capital Expenditures\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n\u00a0\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\nApproximately $500 million\n</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe Company\u2019s guidance includes its current view of the anticipated impact of enacted tariffs by the <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">U.S.</span> and other countries but does not include potential effects of evolving trade policies, such as future changes in tariffs or other trade policies, including retaliatory measures or countermeasures.\n</p>\n<p>\nEnd Notes\n</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\n(1)\n</p>\n</td>\n<td rowspan=\"1\" colspan=\"1\">\n<p>\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted SG&amp;A, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Adjusted Equity Method Investment Earnings, and Adjusted EBITDA, are non-GAAP financial measures.

The Company also presents net sales and price/mix growth at constant currency, which provide information on the percentage change in net sales and price/mix growth, respectively, as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant between the prior and current periods. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in <span class=\"location\" value=\"LC/us\">the United States of America</span> (\u201cGAAP\u201d) that are also presented in this press release. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as gross profit, SG&amp;A, income from operations, income tax expense, net income, diluted earnings per share, net sales, and other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures. For example, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way as the Company does.\n</p>\n<p>\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in analyzing what management views as the Company\u2019s core operating performance for purposes of business decision making. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with useful supplemental information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding impacts of foreign currency exchange translation and unrealized derivative activities and other items affecting comparability between periods, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate the Company\u2019s core operating performance across periods, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company\u2019s financial performance. In addition, the Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those GAAP financial measures, provides investors with additional tools to understand the factors and trends affecting the Company\u2019s underlying business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Company has also provided guidance in this press release with respect to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. The Company cannot predict certain items that are included in reported GAAP results, including items such as costs and other charges relating to the Company\u2019s previously announced Cost Savings Program and Restructuring Plan or other cost savings initiatives; strategic developments; impacts of unrealized mark-to-market derivative gains and losses; impacts of foreign currency exchange gains and losses; impacts of blue chip swap transactions; other non-recurring items such as shareholder activism expenses; and other items impacting comparability. This list is not inclusive of all potential items, and the Company intends to update the list as appropriate as these items are evaluated on an ongoing basis. In addition, the items that cannot be predicted can be highly variable and could potentially have significant impacts on the Company\u2019s GAAP financial measures. As such, prospective quantification of these items is not feasible without unreasonable efforts, and a reconciliation of forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA to net income has not been provided.\n</p>\n<p>\nForward-Looking Statements\n</p>\n<p>\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Words such as \u201cdeliver,\u201d \u201cexecute,\u201d \u201cremain,\u201d \u201cachieve,\u201d \u201cincrease,\u201d \u201csupport,\u201d \u201cmitigate,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201ctarget,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this press release, which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company undertakes no responsibility for updating these statements, except as required by law.\n</p>\n<div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper
