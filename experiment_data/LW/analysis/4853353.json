This was in part the result of inflationary pressure and market share losses, as activist involvement pushing for changes looked compelling.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Despite efforts to improve the positioning, cash flow generation, and a general intent to reduce costs, the 2026 outlook is rather underwhelming here, which makes it that while stability has arrived, the situation is far from inspiring here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Potatoes &amp; Frozen Goos</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Lamb Weston was spun off from Conagra Brands (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAG\" title=\"Conagra Brands, Inc.\">CAG</a>) a decade ago, back in 2016, to be more precise. The company is a producer of frozen foods, potatoes in particular, as well as a wide range of related products, including fries and potatoes, but also twisters and dippers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company produces and distributes such products to restaurants through the wholesale channel as well as retail outlets. Fries play a key role in this, being one of the most popular items on the restaurant menu while being the most profitable one as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Just over a $3 billion business at the time of the separation, the company has doubled sales in just about 7 years, although the company has found itself in a rougher space in recent years. The company is the market leader in the North American frozen potato category and the second-largest player in the global frozen potato category, operating dozens of factories across the globe while employing about 10,000 workers to produce all these products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The company has doubled sales, driven by a combination of continued demand for fries, inflationary pressures, and some M&amp;A efforts. Operating margins have come in anywhere between ten and twenty percent of sales, while minimal share buybacks have been delivered upon lately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">When I last looked at the shares in the spring of this year, shares had lost half their value from a 2023 peak to levels at $51. Following the purchase of the European joint venture, the company originally guided for fiscal 2024 sales around $6.8 billion. EBITDA was seen near $1.5 billion, with earnings seen around $5.20 per share. However, the results came in short compared to the guidance, driven by softer inflationary trends but also market share losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">After missing on the 2024 results, Lamb Weston guided for 2025 sales at a midpoint of $6.7 billion. EBITDA had been seen down to a midpoint of $1.43 billion with earnings seen around $4.60 per share, all while net debt of $3.7 billion was rather substantial, also amidst continued net capital investments, buybacks, and dividends. By the spring, the full-year sales guidance was cut to $6.4 billion, yet worse is that EBITDA was seen down to just $1.19 billion, with earnings seen in the low $3s, as the general situation was rather uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Down to $51 per share, the market value of Lamb Weston fell to $7.3 billion, yet at the same time, net debt was up to $4.0 billion, for a 3.4 times leverage ratio, with investors feeling at unease with the situation. Believing sustainable operating margins to come in around 10-12% of sales, I originally believed that in between a prevailing revenue base and the situation at large, sustainable earnings were actually seen just below $3 per share. That would imply that shares traded around a market multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, some changes were arriving, with Jana Partners getting on board, yet in between reasonable multiples for sustainable earnings, I was hoping for an entry point in the forties, which unfortunately has not materialized.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">A Modest Recovery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Since the spring, shares of Lamb Weston have generally recovered a bit, having traded in a $50-$65 range over the past half a year, currently exchanging hands at $60 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the summer, Lamb Weston <a href=\"https://investors.lambweston.com/news-releases/2025/07-23-2025-130151206\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> pretty flat results for the fiscal year 2025, with revenues down minimally to $6.45 billion, although sales growth returned in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA fell from $1.42 billion in 2024 to $1.22 billion, a bit stronger than guided for after a generally stronger fourth-quarter performance. Adjusted earnings came in at $3.35 per share, all a bit stronger than guided for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Somewhat worrisome is that fiscal 2026 sales were seen as flat at $6.45 billion; however, adjusted EBITDA is seen down to a midpoint of $1.1 billion, weighing on earnings here. Capital spending is seen around $500 million; this number is actually down a bit from a $638 million number in 2025, all while net debt remains very substantial at $4.0 billion. While the company targets cash and cost-cutting efforts, little of these are seen in terms of the improvements in terms of the 2026 guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In September, Lamb Weston <a href=\"https://investors.lambweston.com/news-releases/2025/09-30-2025-133029182\" rel=\"noopener\">reported</a> first quarter sales that were flat, as well as a 1% increase in quarterly adjusted EBITDA to $302 million, with adjusted earnings down four pennies to $0.74 per share. Amidst some modest cash flow improvements, net debt is down to less than $3.9 billion, as all aspects of the outlook are reaffirmed here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">And Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Frankly, Lamb Weston seems to be on a more stable footing here, with volumes gradually recovering, although the quick-service restaurant segment is performing softer as well, with consumers across the world still strapped by inflationary trends, even as its goods become more affordable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">By now, I am still erring a bit on the cautious side. Since the spring, shares have gained some 20%, having moved up from the fifty mark to the sixty mark, while little has changed amidst a rather uninspiring 2026 outlook provided. With earnings power seen as stable at $3 and change per share this year, a high-teens earnings multiple has re-rated to 20 times again, all amidst a non-inspiring performance, but definitely some sense of stability arriving here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The stabilization aspects give room for comfort, but that does not necessarily equate to appeal being evident here; as for that, some real (margin) growth has to return.</p>",
