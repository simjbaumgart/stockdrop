The company said volume growth was driven by customer wins, share gains, and retention, particularly in North America and Asia. The decline in price/mix was noted to reflect the ongoing support of customers through price and trade, including the carryover impact of fiscal 2025 pricing, in a competitive global market environment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted gross profit fell during the quarter due to unfavorable price/mix. Total manufacturing cost per pound was lower, reflecting the benefits from cost savings initiatives and improved operating efficiencies in the North America segment. Those initiatives more than offset inflationary pressures in key input categories other than raw product and higher manufacturing costs per pound in the international segment due to less favorable operating conditions and elevated production expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Non-GAAP EPS of $0.69 beat the consensus estimate of $0.65 but was lower than last year's mark of $0.73.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lamb Weston (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LW\" title=\"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\">LW</a>) is a major supplier to McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>), Burger King (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QSR\" title=\"Restaurant Brands International Inc.\">QSR</a>), Wendy's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEN\" title=\"The Wendy's Company\">WEN</a>), Taco Bell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YUM\" title=\"Yum!
