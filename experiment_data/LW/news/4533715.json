      "content": "<p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: Lamb Weston Holdings (LW) Q2 2026</p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>Mike Smith, President and CEO, stated that \"our global teams are embracing and executing our Focus to Win strategy, strengthening customer partnerships and driving cost savings,\" highlighting that volume growth was up 8% in the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> second quarter and 7% for the first half of the year. He announced the reopening of previously curtailed capacity in North America to meet customer demand and maintain high fill rates, noting, \"North America, the largest segment of our business, is in a solid position.\"</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">Smith emphasized new product launches, cost savings, a 3% increase in the quarterly dividend, and $40 million in share repurchases during the second quarter. He stated, \"We have gained share, including with new and growing customers.\"</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bernadette Madarieta, Chief Financial Officer, reported, \"Second quarter net sales increased 1%, including a $24 million benefit from foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, net sales were essentially flat versus last year. Volume rose 8%, driven by customer wins, share gains and strong retention, especially in North America and Asia.\" She added, \"Adjusted EBITDA declined $9 million compared to last year to $286 million.\"</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The company reaffirmed its fiscal 2026 outlook, including a 53rd week in the fourth quarter. Smith explained, \"We are on track towards delivering the high end of our sales guidance range.\" North America volumes in the second half are expected to grow at or above first half rates, while international volumes are expected to be flat year-over-year.</li> <li>Madarieta said, \"As anticipated, price/mix will remain unfavorable at constant currency in the second half, but to a lesser extent than the first half.\" Adjusted gross margin in the second half is expected to be flat to down versus the first half's 20.4%, with continued cost savings in SG&amp;A.</li> <li>Full year tax rate is projected at 28% to 29% with second half rates in the low 20s. The company maintained its adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, noting, \"We currently expect to finish closer to the midpoint.\"</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Net sales increased 1%, including a $24 million foreign currency benefit; on a constant currency basis, net sales were essentially flat.</li> <li>Volume rose 8%, driven by North America and Asia customer wins, while price/mix declined 8% at constant currency due to price and trade support.</li> <li>North America net sales were flat, with volume up 8% and price/mix down 8%. International segment net sales increased 4%, with a $23 million currency benefit, while volume grew 7% and price/mix declined 8%.</li> <li>Adjusted EBITDA in North America increased 7% to $288 million; international adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million to $27 million, reflecting pricing actions and higher manufacturing costs, notably start-up costs in Argentina.</li> <li>The company ended the quarter with $1.43 billion of liquidity, $1.35 billion available under its revolving credit facility, and $83 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net debt was $3.6 billion with a leverage ratio of 3.1x.</li> <li>Free cash flow was $375 million for the first half, with capital expenditures at $156 million. The quarterly dividend was increased to $0.38 per share, and $40 million in shares were repurchased during the quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Thomas Palmer, JPMorgan: Asked about supply-demand rebalancing and production curtailment in Europe. Smith responded, \"We have also communicated to our employees that we are curtailing a single line in our European market as well. So we are looking across our global supply chain and making sure that we're taking the right approaches to balance that supply and demand globally.\"</li> <li>Palmer followed up on North America volume drivers. Madarieta explained, \"A big piece that we need to consider is that it's not only price, but it's a large component of this is mix...a shift from branded to more private label.\"</li> <li>Peter Galbo, BofA Securities: Sought an update on Asia and export competition. Smith said, \"When you look around the globe, there has been some added capacity in some of those developing markets, like you said, and that is putting more pressure on exports out of Europe into some of those markets, which has challenged the price there a little bit.\"</li> <li>Galbo also clarified gross margin expectations. Madarieta responded, \"The comment that I made in my prepared remarks was definitely for the second half of the year and then that being primarily driven by mix shifts and pricing headwinds as well as the ramp-up that we have in Argentina.\"</li> <li>Robert Moskow, TD Cowen: Queried about reopening North American capacity. Smith confirmed, \"Utilization rates in our North American facilities were in the low 90s as we grew that volume...we needed to open up this additional capacity to ensure that we continue to meet our customers' expectations regarding fill rates.\"</li> <li>Max Gumport, BNP Paribas: Asked about the lower half of EBITDA guidance. Smith replied, \"Turnarounds are not linear...and we're navigating an ongoing competitive environment. We're seeing continued soft traffic.\"</li> <li>William Reuter, BofA Securities: Inquired about pricing and capital allocation with stock down. Smith and Madarieta stated pricing is based on market conditions and capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Analysts pressed on margin trends, capacity decisions, and competition, with a slightly negative tone driven by questions about guidance, mix headwinds, and sustained competitive pressures.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone in prepared remarks, frequently referencing progress and execution, but was more cautious and defensive during Q&amp;A, especially when discussing international challenges and the inability to raise the lower end of EBITDA guidance. The tone was more cautious compared to the previous quarter, when management expressed greater optimism about cost savings and volume gains.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Guidance for fiscal 2026 was reaffirmed, with no increase to the lower end of the adjusted EBITDA range, in contrast to last quarter's hints at potential outperformance.</li> <li>The Focus to Win strategy remains a central theme, but the current call placed more emphasis on mix headwinds, particularly the shift from branded to private label and lower-margin business, as well as international cost and price pressures.</li> <li>Analysts shifted from probing volume and contract wins last quarter to focusing on margin headwinds, supply-demand rebalancing, and the sustainability of cost savings.</li> <li>Management's confidence about North America's stability was reiterated, but greater caution was evident regarding international volatility and persistent soft traffic.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Management repeatedly cited dynamic macroeconomic and competitive environments, especially in international markets.</li> <li>Price/mix headwinds and higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Europe and Latin America, were highlighted as ongoing risks.</li> <li>The ramp-up of the Argentina facility is expected to result in higher cost per pound for the remainder of the year as utilization levels build.</li> <li>Analysts expressed concern about the sustainability of margins, the inability to raise the low end of guidance, and competitive pricing pressures in global markets.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lamb Weston is navigating a challenging environment with volume growth in key segments, the reopening of North American capacity, and a reaffirmed adjusted EBITDA outlook of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. While North America remains solid and cost savings initiatives are on track, the company faces persistent mix and price headwinds and higher international manufacturing costs. Management remains focused on executing its strategy and supporting customer partnerships, but is cautious on margin progression and international volatility for the remainder of the year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/lw/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> <div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div><div id=\"more-links\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h2>More on Lamb Weston</h2> <ul> <li><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854741-lamb-weston-holdings-inc-lw-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.
