        "content": "<p data-eci=\"true\">Earnings Call Insights: KBR, Inc. (KBR) Q3 2025</p> <h3>Management View</h3> <ul> <li>CEO Stuart Bradie stated that \"revenue was flat in the quarter year-on-year and up 5% year-to-date from the prior year,\" with a \"strong book-to-bill of 1.4x for the quarter,\" though most of the conversion is<span class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> expected in future quarters. He outlined significant headwinds in the STS segment, including delayed LNG projects, oversupply in petrochemicals, Middle East unrest, and new tariffs, but emphasized that \"the STS business has proven remarkably resilient,\" having replaced lost revenue with geographical expansion and focus on LNG, ammonia, and energy affordability.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bradie highlighted that \"we delivered excellent bottom line performance in Q3 across all metrics. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up more than 100 basis points year-on-year at 12.4%, delivering an adjusted EBITDA of $240 million, up 10%. This translated into an adjusted EPS of $1.02, an increase of 21% year-over-year.\"</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Operating cash flow stood out, with Bradie noting, \"cash was the standout in the quarter with conversion over 130% year-to-date, generating operating cash of $198 million in the quarter and $506 million year-to-date.\"</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bradie emphasized new contract wins, including a $2.5 billion ceiling value contract for astronaut health and human performance and several strategic contracts with the Air Force Research Laboratory and U.S. Space Force.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In STS, KBR extended a contract for the Majnoon oil field in Iraq, won a consultancy for Abu Dhabi's TAQA, a front-end engineering design contract for Kuwait Oil Company, and the FEED contract for Abadi LNG in Indonesia.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Bradie stated, \"backlog and options now stand at more than $23 billion, and this value represents a 13% increase since prior year-end.\"</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">CFO Mark Sopp stated, \"revenues in the quarter...were $1.9 billion, flat versus the prior year and up 5% on a year-to-date basis,\" with adjusted EBITDA \"quite healthy at $240 million, up 10%, with margins at 12.4%, an increase of over 100 basis points versus the prior year.\"</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sopp added that operating cash flow year-to-date was $506 million, \"an increase of 24% from the prior year,\" attributing strong cash performance to \"successful DSO reduction measures in both segments.\"</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Outlook</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Sopp updated revenue guidance for 2025 to a range of $7.75 billion to $7.85 billion, \"with an updated midpoint of $7.8 billion flat,\" and reaffirmed profit metrics: \"Adjusted EBITDA remains within the range of $960 million to $980 million. We're also reconfirming the corresponding adjusted EPS guidance of $3.78 to $3.88.\"</li> <li>Sopp explained that guidance assumes the government shutdown is resolved in November and noted, \"Other key assumptions in our guidance are unchanged, including tax, CapEx and interest expense.\"</li> <li>Bradie confirmed the spin-off of Mission Technologies is progressing, targeting completion by mid- to late 2026.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Financial Results</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Sopp reported revenues of $1.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $240 million with margins at 12.4%. Adjusted EPS was $1.02, up 21% year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $198 million for the quarter and $506 million year-to-date.</li> <li>In MTS, revenues were $1.4 billion, with Defense and Intelligence growing 14%, offset by a 22% decline in Readiness and Sustainment. Science &amp; Space was down 5%. Adjusted EBITDA for MTS was $143 million, with margins over 10%.</li> <li>STS revenues were $525 million, down 1%, but adjusted EBITDA rose 13% to $123 million, with margins at roughly 23.5%.</li> <li>KBR returned over $120 million to shareholders this quarter and has repurchased over $300 million in shares year-to-date.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Q&amp;A</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Andrew Kaplowitz, Citigroup: Asked about growth prospects for STS and MTS into 2026. Bradie responded that \"the book-to-bill in Q3 and the expected book-to-bill in Q4 gives us pretty good insight, and I think good momentum heading into 2026,\" reaffirming commitment to double-digit STS growth and confidence in MTS growth, especially in Defense &amp; Intel and international segments.</li> <li>Augie Smith, D.A. Davidson: Sought clarity on NASA exposure and budget cuts. Bradie responded that for the rest of the year, \"very little impact,\" and into next year, exposure is \"probably less material\" and under 25% of the portfolio.</li> <li>Michael Dudas, Vertical Research: Inquired about non-LNG STS opportunities. Bradie cited strong activity in the Middle East, especially in Iraq and Kuwait, and ongoing resilience in ammonia and Mura projects, noting commissioning delays but no major concerns.</li> <li>Tobey Sommer, Truist: Asked about spin-off interest and valuation comparables. Bradie declined to comment on acquisition interest, but described the spin-off as \"an amazing opportunity to relaunch the image of the company\" with plans for enhanced branding and business development.</li> <li>Mariana Perez Mora, BofA: Asked about STS margins and Plaquemines run rate. Sopp explained Q3 margin spike was due to milestone progression, but average run rate from first half expected to continue in 2026.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Sentiment Analysis</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Analysts showed a neutral to slightly positive tone, focusing on growth visibility, margin sustainability, and strategic execution. Questions were probing but constructive.</li> <li>Management maintained a confident tone, particularly in reaffirming guidance and highlighting resilience. Bradie frequently referenced \"good momentum\" and \"confidence\" in growth targets. Sopp provided detailed explanations, supporting a slightly more cautious but still upbeat outlook.</li> <li>Compared to the previous quarter, management\u2019s tone was more focused on execution and resilience, while analysts' tone remained consistently focused on operational risks and growth.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Quarter-over-Quarter Comparison</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>The Q3 call reconfirmed adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance, but lowered revenue guidance ($7.75B-$7.85B vs. prior $7.9B-$8.1B). Profitability and cash flow guidance remained unchanged.</li> <li>Management\u2019s confidence appeared stable, with increased emphasis on cash generation and backlog expansion.</li> <li>Strategic focus shifted to executing the upcoming spin-off and maintaining growth in STS and MTS despite conversion and award delays.</li> <li>Analysts continued to press on award timing, margin sustainability, and segment growth, similar to the previous quarter.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Risks and Concerns</h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Management highlighted continued delays in government awards and protests, noting $3 billion in contracts under protest, up 50% from last quarter.</li> <li>The government shutdown is delaying award conversion, particularly in MTS, and may further lower Q4 MTS revenue outlook.</li> <li>STS faces ongoing headwinds from delayed project awards and market uncertainties, but management is mitigating through geographic expansion and focus on robust end markets.</li> <li>Analysts raised concerns about NASA funding, Mura project commissioning delays, and timing of backlog conversion.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Final Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">KBR leadership emphasized strong bottom line results, robust cash flow, and resilient operational performance in the face of delayed awards and macro headwinds. The spin-off of Mission Technologies remains on track, with preparations advancing and a targeted completion by late 2026. Management reaffirmed full-year profit guidance and emphasized the company\u2019s strategic positioning, strong backlog, and confidence in continued value creation for shareholders as market conditions stabilize.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/kbr/earnings/transcripts\">Read the full Earnings Call Transcript</a></p> <div class=\"signup_widget_placeholder\"></div><div id=\"more-links\" class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <h2>More on KBR, Inc</h2> <ul> <li><a class=\"more-link\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835531-kbr-inc-kbr-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">KBR, Inc.
