(<span class="ticker-hover-wrapper"><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG" title="Alphabet Inc.">GOOG</a></span>) are two of the most dominant forces in the technology arena. Both boast market caps above $3 trillion and are key<span class="paywall-full-content"> players in AI and cloud computing. MSFT has been for a while viewed by several analysts as the premium AI compounder due to its early OpenAI partnerships and seamless integration of Copilot across its ecosystem. However, Alphabet has staged a remarkable comeback this year, with its stock surging more than 60% compared to MSFT’s ~14%. This surge saw GOOG </span><a href="https://www.voronoiapp.com/markets/-Alphabet-Overtakes-Microsoft-to-Become-the-Third-Most-Valuable-US-Company-7213" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.voronoiapp.com/markets/-Alphabet-Overtakes-Microsoft-to-Become-the-Third-Most-Valuable-US-Company-7213" target="_blank" class="paywall-full-content">overtake</a><span class="paywall-full-content"> MSFT in market cap, a testament to its solid rise.</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content">To this end, some investors might wonder which of these two stocks offers a better risk-adjusted upside from their current levels. I will turn to an Ordinary Least Squares [OLS] regression to model relationships between key financial drivers (revenue growth, operating margins, and CapEx efficiency), being the independent variables, against the stock returns as the dependent variable. My analysis seeks to provide evidence-based insights into relative valuation and forward potential. Given this background, I am bullish on Alphabet given its tolerance to high capital expenditure amid its accelerated cloud growth.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">Recent Financial Highlights</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">In June this year, MSFT ended its 2025 financial year, delivering revenue of $281.7 billion, marking a YoY growth of 15%. This was primarily driven by <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/07/30/microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-fuels-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Corp.%20today%20announced%20the%20following%20results,the%20corresponding%20period%20of%20last%20fiscal%20year:" rel="nofollow" title="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2025/07/30/microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-fuels-fourth-quarter-results/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Corp.%20today%20announced%20the%20following%20results,the%20corresponding%20period%20of%20last%20fiscal%20year:" target="_blank">Cloud business growth</a> with the total Microsoft cloud revenue growing by 25% YoY. On the other hand, Alphabet’s trailing revenue stands at $385.5 billion, a YoY growth of 13.4%, which is close to MSFT’s trailing revenue growth. This is also being fueled by its Google Cloud, which has accelerated growth to 34% YoY growth in Q3 2025.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Given this financial snapshot, it’s clear that Alphabet is edging MSFT in cloud growth, perhaps due to Azure’s <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366633643/Microsoft-CEO-speaks-of-global-cloud-factory-as-Azure-stalls" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366633643/Microsoft-CEO-speaks-of-global-cloud-factory-as-Azure-stalls" target="_blank">capacity constraints</a>. Taking this further, Microsoft has a higher operating margin, trailing at 46.27%, compared to GOOG’s 33.1%. I think this signals MSFT’s software moat (Office and Windows), which could be delivering this superior profitability. Further, I find both companies to be aggressive in capital expenditure, having a CapEx-to-revenue ratio of more than 20%. This shows their <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/12/alphabet-amazon-and-microsoft-charge-ahead-on-ai-capacity-build-outs" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/2025/12/alphabet-amazon-and-microsoft-charge-ahead-on-ai-capacity-build-outs" target="_blank">commitment</a> to funding AI infrastructure; therefore, this current race is likely to continue in the long run.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652351407356.png?io=w640" alt="Financials" contenteditable="false" width="578" height="476" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652351407356.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652351407356.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652351407356.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="paywall-full-content">With this background, I will now delve into modeling these variables to get deeper insights into how they influence the stock direction.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">The OLS Model: Methodology</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">In this analysis, I used the quarterly data spanning 2020 to 2025 because this is when the AI race started <a href="https://medium.com/@gurvindersodhi45/the-ai-revolution-from-2020-to-2025-dc0ecdfec6c4" rel="nofollow" title="https://medium.com/@gurvindersodhi45/the-ai-revolution-from-2020-to-2025-dc0ecdfec6c4" target="_blank">gaining momentum</a>. This explains why my model doesn’t extend to 10 years or more, as most people would expect. The current stock momentum is largely fueled by the AI boom, and it makes sense to focus on the relevant time period. As mentioned earlier, the dependent variable (Y-variable) is the quarterly stock return, while the independent variables (X-variables) are quarterly YoY revenue growth, operating margin growth, and CapEx-to-revenue ratio as a proxy for growth investment efficiency. Having defined my variables, my overall model for each stock’s analysis is as follows.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652352851229.png?io=w640" alt="Overall Model" contenteditable="false" width="546" height="226" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652352851229.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652352851229.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652352851229.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="paywall-full-content">From the results, it appears that margin expansion is the biggest driver to MSFT’s return, reflecting its high-margin software. High CapEx could drag short term returns but it’s a catalyst to long term growth. I will walk you through deeper insights as I discuss the results. Important to note, all data was obtained from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo Finance.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">The Output</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">The model results show that MSFT has an R-Squared value of 0.72 an indication that it explains 72% of the return’s variance and this is a testament to the model’s fit and reliability because a value above 50% is admissible.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652353202565.png?io=w640" alt="OLS Model" contenteditable="false" width="638" height="432" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652353202565.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652353202565.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652353202565.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="paywall-full-content">As for Alphabet, its R-Squared is 0.68, meaning that the explanatory variables accounts for about 68% of the Y variable variance.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652354908268.png?io=w640" alt="OLS Model" contenteditable="false" width="618" height="430" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652354908268.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652354908268.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652354908268.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="paywall-full-content">Comparing the two models, MSFT’s higher R-square shows that its returns are more tied to its reported fundamentals. This aligns with the perception that it is a high-quality margin-focused compounder, as most of its analysts focus on its high margins as the core stock driver. On the contrary, GOOG’s slightly lower R-squared suggest that its returns are more influenced by other factors outside these fundamentals compared to MSFT. This shows that factors like market sentiments and cycles play a bigger role in determining its stock direction than in MSFT.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">A Deeper Comparative Take</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">Having looked at the overall model fitness and its implications, I will now delve into the beta values and their implications. I will begin with Alphabet’s higher revenue growth beta of 1.82 compared to MSFT’s 1.45. This in my view, explains GOOG’s outperformance in 2025 edging MSFT in cloud growth as previously mentioned. This is a sign of how powerful this outperformance is in catalyzing this stock’s returns. Should Azure’s capacity constraints continue, I wouldn’t be surprised to see GOOG keeping its stock returns consistently above MSFT.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Moving to the change in operating margin beta, MSFT has a higher value at 2.1 compared to 1.35 for GOOG. This indicates that the market has rewarded MSFT’s operating margin expansion much more strongly than Alphabet. I see a clear distinction in these companies whereby the market attaches value on MSFT’s margin while on the other hand rewarding Alphabet’s revenue growth.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">With this dynamics, I draw you the two companies’ <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/tech-megacaps-to-spend-more-than-300-billion-in-2025-to-win-in-ai.html" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/08/tech-megacaps-to-spend-more-than-300-billion-in-2025-to-win-in-ai.html" target="_blank">heavy investment</a> in AI. It is understandable that this significant cash outlay could suppress margins in the short run. As such, this could weigh down MSFT’s return with less punishment on GOOG as long as revenue growth remains strong. This underscores GOOG’s stock resilience in 2025 rising above MSFT amid the high AI investment which I believe investors expect could compress margins.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652355144.png?io=w640" alt="Price Return" contenteditable="false" width="573" height="403" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652355144.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652355144.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-17659652355144.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class="paywall-full-content">Lastly, on CapEx-to-revenue, Microsoft has a higher beta value of -0.65 with a P-value of below 0.05(0.045) meaning it’s statistically significant. This is contrary to Alphabet’s beta of -0.42 with a P-value above 0.05(0.248) which implies that it’s not statistically significant. By having a higher negative coefficient, it signifies that the market has penalized MSFT more heavily for higher CapEx intensity relative to Alphabet.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">This is an indication that Alphabet enjoys a greater investor tolerance for investment cycles. To me, the implication here is that, maybe the market views MSFT as a mature, high-margin company and expects more disciplined capital allocation. On the other hand, Alphabet having a lower and statistically non-significant coefficient signifies that investors accept higher spending as a necessity for sustainable long-term growth. I think this further explains the difference in the two stocks’ price returns YTD, a year where both have growing capital expenditures.</p> <figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-1765965235481477.png?io=w640" alt="CapEx" contenteditable="false" width="581" height="402" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-1765965235481477.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-1765965235481477.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/17/58176392-1765965235481477.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class="paywall-full-content">My Investment Take</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content">Currently, I find Alphabet to be the best pick between the two stocks. My model clearly shows its growth-sensitive profile, and this, in my view, aligns with the ongoing <a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1083533/ai-monetization-set-to-accelerate-in-2026-as-enterprise-adoption-grows-analysts-say-1083533.html" rel="nofollow" title="https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/1083533/ai-monetization-set-to-accelerate-in-2026-as-enterprise-adoption-grows-analysts-say-1083533.html" target="_blank">AI monetization cycle</a>.

The OLS model assumes a linear relationship between variables, which might not always hold. Nevertheless, the two models have shown high predictive power, with all R-squared being above 50%, making them reliable.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">The other possible risk is the possibility of an <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/12/12/ai-bubble-harvard-experts-weigh-in/#:~:text=Three%20Harvard%20faculty%20said%20they,to%20have%20a%20few%20failures." rel="nofollow" title="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/12/12/ai-bubble-harvard-experts-weigh-in/#:~:text=Three%20Harvard%20faculty%20said%20they,to%20have%20a%20few%20failures." target="_blank">AI bubble burst</a>. While GOOG’s value lies in its consistent strong growth, should the bubble burst, leading to low growth, the stock’s value could tumble, leading to losses. Historically, when GOOG experiences low revenue growth, its stock performance is poor. For example, in 2022, when the stock experienced a single-digit revenue growth for the first time in over the last five years, its stock return dipped by 38.7%, the worst annual return performance in more than five years.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content">Conclusion</h2> <div class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content"></div> <p class="paywall-full-content">I recommend buying GOOG over MSFT amid the ongoing heavy capital expenditure in the AI race. The OLS model shows that the market punishes MSFT for aggressive capital expenditure while attaching a high value to GOOG’s revenue growth. While the biggest value driver for MSFT is margin growth, the ongoing capital outlay threatens its short term margin growth sustainability, but Alphabet shows higher investor tolerance. With these ongoing dynamics, I think Alphabet is an outright buy at a discount.</p>

The AI narrative is regaining significant momentum in the market, supported by strong sales figures from companies like NVIDIA Corporation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA" title="NVIDIA Corporation">NVDA</a>), Microsoft Corporation (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT" title="Microsoft Corporation">MSFT</a>) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META" title="Meta Platforms, Inc.">META</a>). Alphabet has stayed steadfast in its commitment to AI, despite high CapEx and questions from investors if AI was eroding its core business. We are now starting to see the true commercial opportunity from these investments in the quarterly results. Alphabet's AI model <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/18/google-announces-gemini-3-as-battle-with-openai-intensifies.html" rel="nofollow">Gemini</a> has become a worthy competitor to other leading AI models in the industry. As Gemini is being integrated into Alphabet's ecosystem, it provides better value and a stronger utility than many other models in the market.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">The future looks bright for Alphabet and its shareholders, but we want to quantify what this opportunity means in terms its overall valuation and stock price, using our DCF model. As always in our DCF model, we start by looking at the latest quarterly performance to see if our previous assumptions made in August need any calibration. We also looked to the latest guidance provided by the leadership team for Q4 and beyond in the latest earnings call <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript">transcript</a>.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content"><strong>Q3 2025 Results - Base For Projection</strong></h2> <div class="table-responsive paywall-full-content"> <span class="sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar"><span data-intersection-boundary="start" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col span="4"> </colgroup> <tr> <td><strong>Sales</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3 2024 </strong></td> <td><strong>Q3 2025 </strong></td> <td><strong>Abs.</strong></td> <td><strong>%</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Services</td> <td>76,510</td> <td>87,052</td> <td>10,542</td> <td>13.8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Cloud</td> <td>11,353</td> <td>15,157</td> <td>3,804</td> <td>33.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other Bets</td> <td>388</td> <td>344</td> <td>(44)</td> <td>-11.3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Alphabet-level activities</td> <td>17</td> <td>-207</td> <td>(224)</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Recurring Sales</strong></td> <td><strong>88,268</strong></td> <td><strong>102,346</strong></td> <td><strong>14,078</strong></td> <td><strong>15.9%</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary="end" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end"></span></span><button type="button" class="sa-table-enlarge-button">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class="table-responsive paywall-full-content"> <span class="sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar"><span data-intersection-boundary="start" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start"></span><table> <colgroup><col span="6"></colgroup> <tr> <td><strong>Sales</strong></td> <td><strong>YTD 2024 </strong></td> <td><strong>YTD 2025 </strong></td> <td><strong>Abs.</strong></td> <td><strong>%</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Services</td> <td>220,836</td> <td>246,859</td> <td>26,023</td> <td>11.8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Cloud</td> <td>31,274</td> <td>41,041</td> <td>9,767</td> <td>31.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other Bets</td> <td>1,248</td> <td>1,167</td> <td>(81)</td> <td>-6.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Alphabet-level activities</td> <td>191</td> <td>-60</td> <td>(251)</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Recurring Sales</strong></td> <td><strong>253,549</strong></td> <td><strong>289,007</strong></td> <td><strong>35,458</strong></td> <td><strong>14.0%</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary="end" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end"></span></span><button type="button" class="sa-table-enlarge-button">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class="paywall-full-content"><em>Table Source: Alphabet <a href="https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf" rel="nofollow">Third Quarter</a> 2025 Results</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Based on the latest quarterly data, we are seeing a sales acceleration in both Services and Cloud in the Q3 2025 figures vs. previous quarters. Services are the most profitable segment for Alphabet with an operating margin of 40.2% YTD. A sales acceleration in this segment has a significant impact on the bottom line. The growth in Services is driven by continued AI investments in Gemini 3, which in the latest quarter had over 650 million monthly active <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/#note-from-ceo" rel="nofollow">users</a>. We also observed slightly lower operating margin in the Service segment in Q3 due to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1992" rel="nofollow">EC fine,</a> fully reflected in this quarter. The EC fine is regarded as a one-off event in our DCF model.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Google Cloud has consistently delivered strong top-line growth in the past quarters. We continue to see a positive trend in operating margin for Cloud, going from 12.9% YTD 2024 to 20.9% YTD 2025.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">Alphabet's accelerated growth does not come for free. The growth is fueled in parts by large CapEx investments which impact its FCF in the coming years.

This supports a higher stock price valuation, however, we also need to consider the higher CapEx spend and its impact on FCF.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">CapEx growth is projected to slow down over the forecast period (% YoY), but the trend is building from a much higher base than before (92 billion vs. 85 billion). This spend has a negative impact on the FCF generation between 2025-2027, however, it improves the FCF generation above previous forecast in the outer years. In other words, Alphabet is ramping up investments now to harvest more cash in the future.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content">All the future years' cashflows are discounted back to assign a valuation of the company today.

We don't see current stock price as an attractive point to buy, but we will be holding on to our shares as long-term investors. Current investors are recommended to continue to hold on to your shares and new investors to wait for a pullback in the market.</p>

I detailed why this ETF performs consistently worse than either GOOGL shares or an individual options strategy, like a short Put Spread (short GOOGL Put, long GOOGL Put at a lower strike price).</span></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">As a reminder, my interest in Alphabet was driven by several factors:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>A strong economic moat for 80%-90% of its business, led by Google Search.</li> <li>Double-digit revenue growth, led by Google Cloud.</li> <li>Huge financial flexibility, with its massive hordes of cash.</li> <li>Undervaluation for most of the last year, influenced by their trial with DoJ (Department of Justice), my Fair Value estimate at the end of August being ~$208.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">This is a very strong and rare combination, and this is why I had a significant Alphabet exposure, more than a normal position, with a threefold strategy:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>A Short Put Spread options strategy (because this strategy gains even with the stock flat or even slightly down), options that eventually expired, bringing ~42% ROI in about 9 months (or about 56% annualized) as described in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818581-options-strategies-or-even-alphabet-stock-are-much-better-than-gooy">my article</a>.</li> <li>A short-term <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756574-alphabet-close-to-fair-value-just-rolling-this-profitable-strategy">stock position</a> (because Alphabet was in a high volatility mode at the beginning of the year), initiated in November’24 at $164.5, and sold in January’25 for ~21% in about 2 months (or 126% annualized).</li> <li>A longer-term <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756574-alphabet-close-to-fair-value-just-rolling-this-profitable-strategy">stock position</a> (because this can have indefinite upside), partly also initiated in November 2024 at $164.5 and partly added at the beginning of May 2025, at $161.75. I <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4786802-alphabet-a-profitable-strategy-even-with-a-slightly-down-stock-price">closed this position</a> in September, at $250 (because it was above my Fair Value at that time), for an average of ~53% ROI in about seven months (or about 91% annualized), let’s say “unfortunately”, because the stock is today at ~$309, for ~90% ROI in about ten months (about 108% annualized). While I did enter very close to the bottom at an average of ~$163, I missed the top, but the difference in annualized ROI is not very big anyway.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">There were some positive developments in the meantime, which made me readjust Fair Value higher. And with the stock around its Fair Value, I am targeting now a powerful neutral strategy through options.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Business Segments</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835024-alphabet-inc-2025-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation">Google Services</a></em> continued to show double-digit growth in Q3’25:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1303" data-height="692" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true" role="button" aria-label="Expand image into lightbox view"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png?io=w640" alt="Figure 1: Google Services Q3'25" width="640" height="340" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352271957335_origin.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Looking out to 2026, they expect a “significant” increase in CapEx, with more details provided on the fourth quarter earnings call.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">There is indeed a huge increase in CapEx related to Google Cloud to fuel this very high growth. I am not very fond of these very capital-intensive businesses, I usually look for asset-light businesses with a lot of operating leverage. But this is true especially for businesses that need to take a lot of debt for these investments, entering a spiral of debt fueling growth, then fueling more debt. Any flame here would be inflammatory.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">However, this is not the case for Alphabet. Not only that they don’t need to take more debt, on the contrary they have so much cash needed to be put to work somehow. They can easily afford to massively increase CapEx, and to go for a significant acquisition like Wiz, and to return capital to shareholders through repurchases of stock of $11.5B and dividend payments of $2.5B.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Fair Value</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">For a <em>relative valuation</em>, I look at a comparison with Alphabet’s five-year averages, because I can’t find a true peer due to Alphabet’s diversified business model:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1135" data-height="392" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true" role="button" aria-label="Expand image into lightbox view"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png?io=w640" alt="Figure 4: Google Relative Valuation" width="640" height="221" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/14/41954486-17657352263942626_origin.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption">Figure 4: Google Relative Valuation <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">As usual, for GARP (Growth At A Reasonable Price) stocks, I look only at growth-adjusted multiples. In this case, for such a mature and profitable company, I look at PEG.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">According to Seeking Alpha, PEG is 1.86, about 37% higher than the 5Y average. However, this considers a 15.7% <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL/growth">EPS 3-5Y CAGR</a>. If we look at the estimates for the next 2 years, we have ~24.5% expected EPS growth, which will give a PEG = 1.19. I doubt that EPS growth will drop that much for the 3-5Y horizon, considering that revenue growth will decay much more slowly.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">By averaging the two PEGs above, we have a weighted PEG of ~1.52, for about 13% overvaluation.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">For an <em>absolute valuation</em>, I use a 10-year DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) model with the following assumptions:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>Revenue growth 2025-2029: consensus.</li> <li>Revenue growth 2030-2034: declining from 10% to 6%, but higher than in my last article, fueled by AI, TPU, cybersecurity.</li> <li>Gross profit margin 2025-2029: from 59% to 61%.</li> <li>R&amp;D growth 2025-2029: 7%.</li> <li>S&amp;M growth 2025-2029: 6%.</li> <li>G&amp;A margin: very slightly but constantly declining.</li> <li>Terminal EBIT margin: 42%</li> <li>Perpetual growth: 3.5% (from 3% in my last article), fueled by Waymo or quantum computing.</li> <li>Tax rate: 16%, an average of the last years.</li> <li>WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 9%, mostly cost of equity. With this business model focused on ads and cloud, I use ~11% for a no-moat company, then I subtract ~0.8% for a strong economic moat (~80% of the business), ~1% for their financial flexibility, and another ~0.2% for their business diversification ahead.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">With these parameters, my Fair Value estimate increased to $294, with higher growth estimated for all periods, including in perpetuity. This means about 5% potential downside from the current price ($309.3), and that is not far from the relative valuation, placing the stock in the “Hold” zone.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">For a sensitivity analysis, I usually vary the parameters with the highest uncertainty. In this case, let’s vary WACC and growth in perpetuity:</p> <div class="table-responsive paywall-full-content invisible"> <span class="sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar"><span data-intersection-boundary="start" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fair Value</strong></p></td> <td><p>WACC=10%</p></td> <td><p>WACC=9%</p></td> <td><p>WACC=8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Growth=2.5%</p></td> <td><p>$221.6</p></td> <td><p>$260.5</p></td> <td><p>$314.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Growth = 3.5%</p></td> <td><p>$244.4</p></td> <td><p><strong>$294</strong></p></td> <td><p>$366.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Growth=4.5%</p></td> <td><p>$275.5</p></td> <td><p>$342.4</p></td> <td><p>$447.9</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary="end" data-test-id="table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end"></span></span><button type="button" class="sa-table-enlarge-button">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Table 1: GOOGL Fair Value estimates (Author)</em></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">We can observe a significant variation in Fair Value for slight variations in these inputs, therefore a high to very uncertainty.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Strategy: Neutral, But With High Probability of Success</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">One of most used neutral strategies is a <em>Calendar Spread</em>: sell an ATM (At-The-Money) Call or Put option and buy a longer-dated one. This is typically used when IV (Implied Volatility) is low because, if IV increases at the first expiration (when the short option expires), then we can sell our long option for a higher price.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">But I typically try to find specific cases when the spread is very tight, meaning that I pay a low premium and I can gain more or a high maximum return / cost. For example:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>Buy GOOGL 305 Put Jun’26 for $2685 debit.</li> <li>Sell GOOGL 305 Put May’26 for $2485 credit.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Please notice these are estimated average prices during the weekend. With a very good liquidity, I expect to get close to these averages. However, if GOOGL were above $310, I might chose a 310 Put Calendar instead of the 305 one.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Let’s see the performance of this position at the first expiration (May 15) and if we close it earlier. It’s important to notice that there will be an earnings report somewhere at the end of April, and after earnings IV will drop. Historically, GOOGL’s <a href="https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/GOOGL/IV/ivTerm" rel="nofollow">IV30</a> (Implied Volatility for options expiring in 30 days) was about 30% without an earnings report, meaning about 15%-20% lower than current IV for those options. Therefore, I will model 18% lower IV in May:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="1116" data-height="502" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true" role="button" aria-label="Expand image into lightbox view"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png?io=w640" alt="Figure 5: GOOGL Calendar" width="640" height="288" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761403544_origin.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption">Figure 5: GOOGL Calendar <span>(Options Profit Calculator)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Strategy cost</em>: $200, the paid premium. On the upside, both Put options would expire worthless. On the downside, I disagree with the model from the above chart that maximum risk is ~$300 with GOOGL under ~$240: with both Puts deep ITM (In-The-Money), we will be assigned, but we can also assign our long Put at the same price and we’ll just lose the difference in premiums. There is indeed some discussion about margin, to be clarified later.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Maximum return</em>: ~$680 (estimated with IV 18% lower for the long 305 Put Jun’26 in May), for 340% ROI in ~5 months, or ~816% annualized. This is an astonishingly high max. reward / cost ratio, but we should notice it happens only at the top of the chart, and only if we keep the position until the first expiration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Profitability range</em>: ~$283-$334 at the first expiration in May.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Handling the position earlier</em>: If the position is already significantly profitable, I will likely close it before the earnings report in April to avoid a price movement outside the profitability range. For example, on April 15, we can observe a much lower, but still significant, max. return of ~$214 (see Figure #5), for ~107% ROI in ~4 months, or ~321% annualized. At the same time, we can observe a slightly increased profitability range, ~$277-$347 (estimated).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Increasing the profitability range</em>: If the stock moves down, I could close the position at a loss, because I would like a moderately bullish position for an overall profit (more about that later). However, it’s a little different if the stock moves up, I’m not confident even with a neutral-to-bearish position to recoup this loss for a GARP stock.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">With GOOGL around $335 in April, I could close the position for ~$87, still a respectable ~43.5% ROI in ~4 months, or ~130% annualized. But in February, for example, I could get only ~$20, which is not satisfactory. That’s why I am trying to increase the profitability range by selling another OTM (Out-of-The-Money) Calendar if the stock is somewhere around $335 very quickly, therefore transforming the position into a <em>Double Calendar</em>:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>Buy GOOGL 305 Put Jun’26 for $2685 debit (initial position).</li> <li>Sell GOOGL 305 Put May’26 for $2485 credit (initial position).</li> <li>Sell GOOGL 360 Call May’26 for $1350 credit (initiated in February).</li> <li>Buy GOOGL 360 Call Jun’26 for $1648 debit (initiated in February).</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Per total, $498 debit (strategy cost), and let’s see how this modified position would perform:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><span><a href="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png" rel="lightbox" data-width="903" data-height="452" data-og-image-twitter_small_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_large_card="true" data-og-image-twitter_image_post="true" data-og-image-msn="true" data-og-image-facebook="true" data-og-image-google_news="true" data-og-image-google_plus="true" data-og-image-linkedin="true" role="button" aria-label="Expand image into lightbox view"><img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png?io=w640" alt="Figure 6: GOOGL Calendar To Double Calendar" width="640" height="320" contenteditable="false" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761217546_origin.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"></a></span><figcaption><p class="item-caption">Figure 6: GOOGL Calendar To Double Calendar <span>(Options Profit Calculator)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">If we close the position by mid-April, we increased the profitability range to ~$286-$371 (see the thick line in the above chart) by decreasing max. return to ~$214, with GOOGL around $305. That means 214/498 = ~43% in ~ 4 months, or ~129% annualized.</p> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Risk Management</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Risk #1</em>…GOOGL below ~$277 by ~April:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">I close the position for a loss, for example ~$100 loss with GOOGL at $266 by mid-April (see Figure #5), a much smaller loss than ~$227 at the expiration in May.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Then, at $266 and with the same Fair Value ($294), GOOGL won’t be much undervalued, but I have a favorite strategy for these scenarios, a <em>Bull Put Spread</em>. For example:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>Short GOOGL 250 Put, about 6 months expiration</li> <li>Long GOOGL 225 Put, about 6 months expiration.</li> </ul> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">This strategy will be profitable with GOOGL above $250 (and I would say that GOOGL becomes clearly undervalued under this level).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">The strike prices could be 250/225 like above, but they also could be 245/225 etc. My target is to have a maximum profit about double the accumulated loss from the Calendar (for example, if I had 5 Calendar positions closed for $100 loss each, I target now ~$1000 max. profit from the bull Put Spread).</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">It’s important to keep the initial Calendar position relatively small, ½ of a normal position at most (I might start with ¼ in this case), because we need to add now some more funds in order to reach this profitability target. On the other side, that Calendar has a very high return on favorable stock prices to be happy with a ½ position or even less.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Risk #2</em>…GOOGL above $371 by ~April:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Even with a Double Calendar, the position will incur losses with GOOGL above ~$371, as described above. Let’s see the estimated probability of this event by using a stock price <a href="https://biocrudetech.com/index.php?option=com_blankcomponent&amp;view=default&amp;Itemid=660" rel="nofollow">probability calculator</a>:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><figure class="regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible" contenteditable="false"><picture> <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761280448.png?io=w640" alt="Figure 7: GOOGL Stock Price Probability" contenteditable="false" width="553" height="347" loading="lazy" srcset="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761280448.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761280448.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/12/15/41954486-17658043761280448.png?io=w240 240w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px"> </picture><figcaption><p class="item-caption">Figure 7: GOOGL Stock Price Probability <span>(BoiCrude Technologies)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">First, it’s important again to close the position early. With GOOGL at ~$375, there will be ~$100 loss if closing by mid-April, but ~$225 loss if closing at the expiration in May.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Then, for this ~18% probability, and considering my Fair Value estimate of $294, I am a bit more comfortable with a neutral-to-bearish continuation position at this price than I would be at ~$347. For example, a <em>Bear Call Spread</em> is a mirror strategy of the Bull Put Spread described for Risk #1. I could set a Bear Call Spread profitable with GOOGL under $390 or under $395, or another neutral-to-bearish strategy, but only after reassessing Fair Value.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Risk #3</em>…The stock suddenly jumps over ~$335:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">As described above, I intend to transform the Calendar into a Double Calendar if GOOGL advances to ~$335 in order to increase the profitability range. But what if the stock jumps ~10% or more in a single trading session from, say, $319 to $351? I think this is the most unfavorable scenario because I am in the zone where I am not very comfortable with a neutral-to-bearish continuation position.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">There could still be some continuations for an overall profit, but more complex. Besides, this scenario has a very low probability. For now, I see only one event that could trigger a 10%+ jump in a single trading session: the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL/earnings">earnings report</a> from the beginning of February. Even more, the stock has to be somewhere between $310 and $330 just before earnings, because if the stock is at $300 and then jumps 10%, I will still be in the profitability range at $330.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible"><em>Caution</em>…A word about assignment:</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">While not quite a risk, it’s important to know that an early assignment can happen for our short Put if it is ITM, for example just on the ex-dividend date if the Put’s extrinsic value is less than dividend value. More likely than not this is, in fact, a good event, because the owner of the May 305 Put gave up the extrinsic value of the Put (to collect the dividend), while our long June 305 Put has (normally) a higher extrinsic value than later in time, so we can sell it higher.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">There are, however, two things to keep in mind:</p> <ul class="paywall-full-content invisible"> <li>Margin loan: Suppose that we initially had $15K balance and 1 GOOGL 305 Put Calendar. Then, we are assigned for our short 305 Put =&gt; 100 GOOGL shares, 1 long 305 Put, and negative $15.5K cash balance, and we’ll need to pay interest for this negative balance. However, this is a negligible event because we can immediately exercise our long Put or close the Put and the shares to restore positive cash and paying interest for a single day is negligible.</li> <li>Margin call: We should always keep an eye on our portfolio margin requirements, I am never even close to a margin call because I keep ample extra funds. But if you are close to a margin call, it’s better to avoid ANY new position that can move you beyond that threshold considering a negative development.</li> </ul> <h2 class="paywall-full-content invisible">Takeaway</h2> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">Alphabet has a diversified revenue stream, with still double-digit growth in Google Services, fueled by Search and YouTube, and with more than 30% growth in Google Cloud. Emerging AI/TPU/Quantum initiatives will likely support continued double-digit growth ahead, despite natural Search ad deceleration.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">CapEx is aggressively rising to $91–$93B in 2025, but strong cash reserves enable aggressive CapEx for Cloud, meaningful acquisitions like Wiz, and shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends.</p> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">My updated Fair Value of $294, reflecting robust growth ahead in Google Cloud, Gemini/Anthropic, TPU, Waymo, and even in perpetuity, with their quantum leadership.</p> <div class="before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible"></div> <p class="paywall-full-content invisible">I'm implementing a neutral options strategy through a Calendar, with up to 340% ROI in ~5 months. However, I will most likely close it early before the earnings report in April for up to ~107% ROI in ~4 months, or ~321% annualized. On the downside, I would close the position early for a loss and continue with a neutral-to-bullish Bull Put Spread strategy for an overall profit. On the upside, I would first increase the profitability range by transforming the position into a Double Calendar. If the stock continues to climb, I would close the position for a loss and likely continue with a neutral-to-bearish position.</p>
