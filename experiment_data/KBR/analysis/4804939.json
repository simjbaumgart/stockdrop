If you click to learn why, the system explains that KBR has characteristics \u201cnormally associated\u201d with poor future performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I will argue that this warning is more applicable to short-term traders and less applicable to long-term investors. While the price may be sliding, earnings keep growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That suggests a value investing opportunity; I expect the price to rise by just over 13% in one year and maintain my Buy rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The system lists two metrics that signal trouble: decelerating momentum and negative EPS revisions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Momentum</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, this table shows how momentum has fluctuated over the past year, from D to D-, to D+, and then to F in the past four quarters.

Investors became concerned that KBR would be harmed by federal spending cuts by the then new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further uncertainty came in December when Irenic Capital Management, an activist investment firm, reported it had accumulated a 1% stake in the company. Reports suggested Irenic wanted to split up KBR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the chart above shows, the price has kept drifting down since November, which is not surprising as the uncertainty about tariffs and spending cuts continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Are investor concerns justified? Perhaps, but as KBR President and CEO Stuart Bradie observed on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4782264-kbr-inc-kbr-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4782264-kbr-inc-kbr-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q1-2025 earnings call</a>,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>KBR, as you know, is a high-end technology and professional services business and does not import our [or] export products as a significant part of our business.

They have five Strong Buys, one Buy, and three Holds. To put this another way, there are twice as many Buys and Strong Buys as there are Holds\u2014and there are no Sell or Strong Sell ratings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What\u2019s more, they have an average, one-year price target of $64.63, a 37.25% increase over the July 24 closing price of $47.09. The lowest of the price targets is $54.00, presumably provided by one of the analysts with a Hold rating, which represents a 14.7% increase. Even the lowest of these targets is substantial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, on this issue, the consensus among the Wall Street analysts is for double-digit normalized earnings growth this year and near double-digit growth next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clearly, we have some form of disconnect here. Negative earnings revisions by Wall Street analysts are rebutted by their own ratings, price targets, and earnings forecasts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make sense of the various perspectives on earnings, consider short-term and long-term approaches to investing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short term, let\u2019s say a month to six months, it\u2019s possible the share price could continue falling as uncertainty over tariffs and Irenic linger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, in the long term, we should expect KBR\u2019s earnings to grow and push up the share price.

If nothing else, this means the company should be busy for at least a couple of years, even if its customers are affected by tariffs or if there is an economic slowdown (bearing in mind that backlog doesn\u2019t necessarily turn into revenue and earnings, but the odds are on KBR\u2019s side).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, not only does the company expect it will do better this year than last year, but also that it will do <em>much</em> better. Wall Street analysts expect normalized EPS to reach $3.81 for the year, a 14.18% gain over 2024:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2602\" data-height=\"1112\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"KBR EPS estimates table\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535005726365633_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">KBR EPS estimates table <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The KBR share price</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While earnings have risen and are expected to keep rising, the share price has gone in the opposite direction since last November:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2102\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"KBR 10-year price chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/7/25/24320523-17535006115611002_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">KBR 10-year price chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When earnings are going up and the price is going down, there may be opportunities for value investors and others.

Specifically, I will take three quarters of their 2025 estimate of 14.18% (since one quarter is already complete), and one quarter of the 2026 estimate of 9.66%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That works out to 13.06%, and adding that amount to the July 25 closing price of $47.15 gives us a target of $53.31. Given this significant increase in the share price and bullish earnings situation, I will maintain my Buy rating, and for essentially the same reason. KBR has a significant amount of upside potential, despite the uncertainties that drive the share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted, the Wall Street analysts have a one-year target of $64.63, an increase of 37.07% increase over the closing price. They have a collective Buy, based on five Strong Buys, one Buy, and three Holds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One other Seeking Alpha analyst has posted a rating in the past 90 days, a Buy. And the Quant system has a Sell, based on its quantitative concern about momentum and negative net earnings revisions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I believe the Quant system is too heavily reliant on the current share price and negative earnings revisions, it may be correct in both the short term and long term. The share price could continue to slip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of its revenue originates with the federal government, and budget cuts may reduce the number or value of new contracts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of the first quarter, tariff issues had not affected its costs or it markets. However, management did express concern about its customers being affected by tariffs, and as a result might spend less with KBR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs or other economic factors such as interest rates, might drive down demand for its services. A recession or other economy-wide slowdown could affect both its revenue and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It competes with other large and economically powerful firms, and as a result could lose market share or have its reputation harmed if there are any serious problems or mistakes by its personnel or contractors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I have shown, concern about decelerating momentum and negative earnings revisions are of limited value in assessing the future of KBR, Inc.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shareholders and would-be investors would be better served studying the fundamentals, which strongly suggest continuing increases on the top and bottom lines, backed up by $20.5 billion worth backlog and options.</p> <figure class=\"getty-figure paywall-full-content\" data-type=\"getty-image\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w750\" alt=\"Help, support, advice, guidance signpost\" data-id=\"519749080\" data-type=\"getty-image\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/cdn/s3/uploads/getty_images/519749080/image_519749080.jpg?io=getty-c-w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 132px), (max-width: 1200px) calc(66.6vw - 72px), 600px\" fetchpriority=\"high\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p> <p class=\"item-credits\">3D_generator</p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div>",
