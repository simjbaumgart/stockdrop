These Zaibatsu are the roots of all the powerful Japanese companies that still exist today. Tokio Marine was part of the Yasuda zaibatsu. While these were formally dismantled by the Allies after WW2, Japanese companies continued with a 'Keiretsu' model, which quietly replaced the formal corporations with cross shareholdings that continued the entrenched business relationships. Key shareholdings of Tokio Marine include Toyota, Mitsubishi, Suzuki, as well as their competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">The Japanese regulator, the FSA, has been pushing the Japanese insurers to unload these cross shareholdings, and in 2024, this came to a head, as reported here, with an order from the FSA for the big four Japanese insurers to unload $43bn of such cross shareholdings. (As a sidebar, you might have noticed Warren Buffett has recently invested in Japanese industrials. In the insurance industry, Berkshire Hathaway is where you go when you have a problem. I'd speculate that Berkshire has made mostly off market deals which have allowed large divestments without creating stock price volatility.)</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>Then The Walls</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">With a very slow-growing Japanese economy, and an overall profitable domestic business, Tokio has had to look outside Japan to deploy capital and generate growth. They have made several acquisitions over the years:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"> <li>Kiln - A Lloyds of London P&amp;C Insurer and Reinsurer in 2007</li> <li>Philadelphia - a U.S. P&amp;C Insurer in 2018</li> <li>Delphi in 2011 - Delphi is an employee benefits carrier</li> <li>Houston Casualty 'HCC' in 2015 - HCC is a U.S. based global Casualty and Specialty underwriter</li> <li>PURE Insurance in 2019 - PURE is a high net worth home and contents carrier (think rich folks with homes near the coast)</li> </ul> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content invisible\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1249\" data-height=\"176\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1249\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/4773591-1747664902317036_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Tokio Marine</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Through these acquisitions, Tokio Marine now writes as much international business and Japanese business. This strategic diversification makes a lot of sense. Japan is a low growth market, and Japan has a large exposure to both earthquakes - Tokyo, in the shadow of Mt Fuji pictured above, is in an active seismic area, and tropical cyclones which can impact large areas of the country in a single event. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">However, their chosen acquisitions have also dogged the company with issues over the years, from general poor underwriting results at Kiln, to the current challenge of Commercial Real Estate investments at Delphi. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Diversification means stepping out of your competence zone, and this can be a painful process. Kiln wrote much heavier exposures in its US and international business than Tokio saw in Japan, and Delphi writes business with much longer duration liabilities, where the asset management and reserving are crucial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I mention this in the context of a big strategic challenge that faces Tokio Marine.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\"><strong>The Strategic Dilemma</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Tokio now has to find a way to re-invest the capital freed up by selling off the cross shareholdings discussed above. As reported by industry source the <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=17cd121bdb2e14ba082f08eda3b67f8b8536b2685cfbfacb10c2f96361b3481fJmltdHM9MTc0NzYxMjgwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=1a78999f-68c9-665e-3d98-8bca6938677e&amp;psq=tokio+marine+ocerseas+investments&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdXJhbmNlam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjQvMDMvMjAvNzY1NzQxLmh0bQ&amp;ntb=1\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=17cd121bdb2e14ba082f08eda3b67f8b8536b2685cfbfacb10c2f96361b3481fJmltdHM9MTc0NzYxMjgwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=1a78999f-68c9-665e-3d98-8bca6938677e&amp;psq=tokio+marine+ocerseas+investments&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5zdXJhbmNlam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLzIwMjQvMDMvMjAvNzY1NzQxLmh0bQ&amp;ntb=1\" target=\"_blank\">Insurance Journal</a>, Tokio now has $10bn of cash burning a hole in its pocket. It needs to find a way to deploy this capital while avoiding the pain that can be caused by 'di-worsification' - growing via the acquisition of substandard assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So, in a nutshell, Tokio faces a big opportunity, in terms of being able to recycle funds from passive, low growth investments into acquiring insurance businesses that can drive real growth. However, there is also a risk, in that buying the wrong asset can generate major problems too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">So far, there has been little news of this. Let's have a look at the performance of the stock and the existing business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Investor Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Over the last five years, Tokio Marine has performed well versus peers. Here I chose non-Japanese global peers, Allianz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALIZY\" title=\"Allianz SE\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:ALIZY</a>) AIG (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIG\" title=\"American International Group, Inc.\">AIG</a>) and market favorite Chubb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CB\" title=\"Chubb Limited\">CB</a>). While all have done well, Tokio wins by a nose in terms of total return. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content invisible\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/saupload_05ed7feade9e4778d1532bf8ef555a73.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/saupload_05ed7feade9e4778d1532bf8ef555a73.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/saupload_05ed7feade9e4778d1532bf8ef555a73.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/5/19/saupload_05ed7feade9e4778d1532bf8ef555a73.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Business Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">On Feb 14th, Tokio, which follows the April 1st Japan financial year, reported <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2024/o1ckc9000000vk0g-att/Overview_of_3Q_FY2024_Results_e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2024/o1ckc9000000vk0g-att/Overview_of_3Q_FY2024_Results_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q3 results</a>.

While much of the international business is casualty &amp; specialty, Tokio has very large exposure to Japanese Earthquake, Tsunami and Wind/Flood. PURE is also a property underwriter, and high-value homes tend to be in risky locations near the coast. Kiln remains a big property cat writer</li> <li>Acquisition and integration risk, as discussed above.</li> <li>CRE valuation risk - while reserves seem to be stable, this has been a painful topic and downside risk remains.</li> <li>Casualty reserving in the US business. US casualty reserves have been deteriorating across the market, offset by favorable workers compensation development. Delphi has introduced challenges on the asset side, but has probably helped the underwriting results with positive worker compensation reserve releases. These are now drying up across the industry. </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Conclusion &amp; My Position</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">I see Tokio Marine as a best-in-class performer in its home market. I am hopeful in the long term that unwinding the cross shareholdings will result in increasing prices in the Japanese market. However, this will require a generation of management to turnover. Change is a slow process in Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">In the international business, I think that it is more of a sum of the parts than a cohesive entity. There are some good businesses in there, and with $10bn to spend, there is opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Overall, I see Tokio Marine as a solid long-term play. However, I do see the current valuation at 15x to be on the high side for a company that targets 8% EPS growth in the P&amp;C insurance business. I would be a buyer at a forward PE of 12x or below $35. I rate Tokio Marine as a Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content invisible\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content invisible\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
