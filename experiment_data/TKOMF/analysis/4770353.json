I see a risk that the company pays out a below-expectations proportion of earnings to its shareholders going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TKOMY is reliant on asset sales to fund capital allocation moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company targets to lower the balance of its non-core investments to below <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2024/o1ckc9000000h0qm-att/Interim_IR_conference_FY2024_v2_E.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">\u00a52,500 billion</a> in the 12-month period up to end-Mar this year. It expects to divest JPY0.75 trillion of non-strategic shareholding interests in this fiscal year. This is +242% more than what it did for FY23 (\"YE March 31, 2024\")</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My prediction is that TKOMF will realize a lower level of divestiture proceeds in the years ahead. This doesn't bode well for its capital return outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its goal is to conclude this portfolio restructuring exercise by March 31, 2030. This implies that the company's estimated annual monetization amount for the next 5-year period will be JPY 500 billion, or two-thirds of FY2024's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company spent \u00a50.10-0.12 trillion on yearly buybacks in the FY21-23 time frame.

The mean dividends-to-earnings ratio for listed entities worldwide is close to <a href=\"https://www.fidelity.com.sg/articles/analysis-and-research/2024-04-03-asian-stocks-enter-the-dividend-age-1712557419883\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">50%</a>, or the same as Tokio's current payout. The market won't be pleased, assuming that it makes unfavorable tweaks to its existing stance on dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock's FY24 capital management yield (\"sum of buybacks and dividends divided by market capitalization\") is anticipated to be a decent 4.6 percent. This figure is derived based on its current-year dividend guide and existing repurchase program expiring in mid-May '25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan's MS&amp;AD Insurance Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSADF\" title=\"MS&amp;AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc.\">MSADF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSADY/\">MSADY</a>) [8725:JP] boasts an equally attractive consensus next twelve months' dividend yield of 4.5% (source: S&amp;P Capital IQ). If TKOMF's shareholder return isn't as competitive as its peer, investors might consider alternatives. This has prompted me to downgrade the name.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Company Has Solid Inorganic Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the recent RBC Financial Institutions Conference (event report not publicly available) in early-March, TKOMF indicated that it is seeking \"differentiated assets\" to enhance \"the franchise\". </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not bearish on the stock despite my concerns about its dividends and buybacks.

The superior returns were achieved by delivering financial improvement at acquirees and timing such purchases well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The targets taken over by the company have subsequently expanded at a more rapid pace than their respective benchmarks, as outlined below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Performance Of TKOMF's Investees Post-Integration </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"883\" data-height=\"945\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The Performance Of TKOMF's North American Investees Post-Integration \" width=\"640\" height=\"685\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"685\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/24/5969741-17428732771199613_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Presentation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's time for Tokio to revisit its deal pipeline again, as the Fed is in a rate-cutting cycle now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TKOMY's prior major M&amp;As were done when US interest rates were low or on a declining trend. These tend to be periods where insurance markets underperformed. This throws up good chances for purchasing quality assets on the cheap. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TKOMF noted at this month's RBC investor event (\"referred to above\") that it is mainly focused on E&amp;S (\"Excess and Surplus\") insurance in North America. This means that the company could either reinforce its presence in this space or even penetrate new insurance sub-segments with the help of acquisitions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Closing Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Hold for Tokio Marine is warranted. I like TKOMF's external growth opportunities. But I'm less optimistic about its capital return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock also doesn't have substantial upside or downside from the valuation angle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>P/B Equation Based On The \"Gordon Growth Model\"</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"787\" data-height=\"293\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/B Valuation Formulae\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/3/25/5969741-17428805290888653_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Book Titled \"The Large-Cap Portfolio\" Authored By Villalta</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My fair P/NAV multiple for the stock is 2.36x derived using the formulae presented in the chart above.
