The Japanese insurer, with its quality earnings and strong growth numbers, does not disappoint. Nor<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> does it evade, readily admitting that certain things - like higher organic profitability - may take longer to achieve. Importantly, the management's plan for realizing sustainable growth is convincing.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In numbers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2022/k82ffv000000fsse-att/Overview_of_4Q_FY2022_Results_e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2022/k82ffv000000fsse-att/Overview_of_4Q_FY2022_Results_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FY2022</a>: performance was affected by one-off losses but exceeded internal projections. Focus on cost control and broader operational efficiency (through digital transformation and other measures) solidified around this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tokio-marine-fy23-net-income-145720155.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tokio-marine-fy23-net-income-145720155.html\" target=\"_blank\">FY2023</a> saw an improvement in results: revenue added 12% and net income nearly doubled, led by international profits (which make up more than half of the group total). Global expansion efforts, across Western markets but also Asia, were recharged with a <a href=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/tokio-marine-targets-international-insurance-buying-spree-482022.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.insurancebusinessmag.com/asia/news/breaking-news/tokio-marine-targets-international-insurance-buying-spree-482022.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">big capital injection</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2024/o1ckc9000000vk0g-att/Overview_of_3Q_FY2024_Results_e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/event/presentation/2024/o1ckc9000000vk0g-att/Overview_of_3Q_FY2024_Results_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">FY2024</a> is shaping up well: for the nine months ended 31 December 2024, adjusted net income (excluding capital gains) reached 90% of the full-year projections. On an actual basis, earnings are expected to increase by 70% year-on-year, along a 6% topline growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not everything is rosy, of course. Japanese operation (life and auto segments, in particular) has been recording year-on-year declines due to currency effects as well as increases in claims and provisions. North American investments in commercial loans are too in the red.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1316\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tokio Marine 3Q FY24 Results: Net and Life Premiums charts\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1316\" height=\"446\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/4/30/saupload_3e63f1407e740e991d7202865d9db0c9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Tokio Marine 3Q FY24 Results (February 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Divestments of business-related equities, up till end-FY29, form the key strategy to raise profitability metrics.

The <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/asiapacific/20250217/6633ed6c1e2541b1a470a07dc66e3be4/c.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://english.news.cn/asiapacific/20250217/6633ed6c1e2541b1a470a07dc66e3be4/c.html\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese economy grew by 0.1% in 2024</a> after a 1.9% expansion the year before; the slowdown is being amplified by the uncertainty around US exports moving forward. Inflation is stubborn, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-economy-grows-faster-than-expected-q4-strong-capex-2025-02-17/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/japan/japans-economy-grows-faster-than-expected-q4-strong-capex-2025-02-17/\" target=\"_blank\">consumption is sluggish</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In spite of it all, the insurance sector remains surprisingly resilient. The demand for insurance products is buoyed by the country's long-standing demographic trends - aging population coupled with rising life expectancy. Coverage for natural catastrophes and cyber risks are among the growth areas. <a href=\"https://insuranceasia.com/insurance/in-focus/what-will-drive-japans-insurance-sector-surpass-470b-2029\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://insuranceasia.com/insurance/in-focus/what-will-drive-japans-insurance-sector-surpass-470b-2029\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese insurance is forecast to grow by 3.9%</a> between now and 2029.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokio Marine (TSE:8766) and the Japanese insurance industry are closely correlated. Only Tokio Marine, among other notable financials, has done better. Its long-term performance is particularly impressive: its three-year total return of 168% exceeded 128% of the industry and 46% of the overall market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2023 and 2024 have seen remarkable rallies in Japanese stocks driven by a range of different factors (governance reforms, strong results of export firms, etc.). 2025 though has been more modest to date and somewhat volatile, owing to profit-taking and more cautious investor sentiment. Tokio Marine's Tokyo listing is down 6.8% in the last 30 days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OTC-traded TKOMF is selling at a trailing P/E of 11x against the Financials' median of 12x. This is way below the level at which the stock was valued two years ago (16x) at the time of my initial article. For its growth record and versus global peers (Allianz (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALIZF\" title=\"Allianz SE\">ALIZF</a>) 14x, Chubb (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CB\" title=\"Chubb Limited\">CB</a>) 13.6x, Zurich (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZURVY\" title=\"Zurich Insurance Group AG\">ZURVY</a>) 16x), Tokio Marine is modestly priced.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are substantial risks to the Buy thesis. The Japanese corporate outlook is fragile, and the state of the global economy is compounding the uncertainty, especially for multinationals like Tokio Marine. Some of its investments are already losing value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sales of business-related equities reduce investment risk but introduce other complexities. Most significantly, the company's near-term performance may be too reliant on the success of this strategy. In turn, the returns from divestment depend on market conditions, which are hard to predict.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, since capital gains from divestment are temporary, the management could struggle under the weight of heavy expectations to maintain <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/download/o1ckc9000000cu1o-att/Part2_e.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/download/o1ckc9000000cu1o-att/Part2_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">target profitability and sustainable growth</a> (return on equity of over 20% and organic growth of 7% CAGR according to the Mid-Term Plan).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the risks, what is reassuring is <a href=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/cfomessage/#anc-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tokiomarinehd.com/en/ir/cfomessage/#anc-5\" target=\"_blank\">Tokio Marine's track record of execution and discipline</a>. This concerns its past acquisitions, but also wider portfolio management and risk diversification - which I believe will continue to be characteristic of the firm. Dividend, at almost 3%, is notable and has grown impeccably till now. And one can safely assume that dividend return will remain stable, even if annual accretions moderate in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Japanese stock market may not go up significantly this year, but given imminent catalysts, Tokio Marine is still worth your while.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
