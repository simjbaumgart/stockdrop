### Market News Summary

Wall Street largely eked out weekly gains on Friday, with the benchmark S&P 500 index ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500)) finishing slightly positive. Sentiment improved due to delayed economic data that reinforced expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts. Meanwhile, oil was in focus after tensions escalated between the U.S. and Venezuela.

On Tuesday, traders received the November nonfarm payrolls report, which also contained information for October. The jobs report was delayed by the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. On the surface, November job growth was [higher than anticipated](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4531912-nonfarm-payroll-growth-in-november-decelerates-from-septembers-rebound). Delving deeper, October saw a big slump. The report indicated that the labor market was cooling.

Then, on Thursday, the delayed consumer price index data for November was published. Consumer inflation came in much [softer than expected](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4532880-cpi-rises-27-yy-in-november-softer-than-expected). However, experts noted issues with data collection, with one economist [calling the report "whacky."](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4533158-experts-note-big-judgment-error-in-november-cpi-report-call-it-whacky)

Also grabbing the spotlight this week were oil prices ([CL1:COM](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CL1:COM)). President Donald Trump [ordered a blockade](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4532355-oil-bounces-after-trump-orders-blockade-of-sanctioned-tankers-off-venezuela) of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela while also designating the Maduro regime as a foreign terrorist organization.

For the week, the S&P ([SP500](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500)) added **+0.1%**, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP:IND](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND)) inched up **+0.5%**. The blue-chip Dow ([DJI](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI)) slipped **-0.7%**.
