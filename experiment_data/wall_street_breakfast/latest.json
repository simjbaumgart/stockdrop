        "title": "What Moved Markets This Week",
        "content": "<p><strong>Classic play</strong></p> <p>U.S. stocks finished higher on Friday, capping off a shortened trading week that saw the S&amp;P 500 (SP500) advance by 1.1%. It was quite the \"Santa Claus rally,\" which describes the tendency for the stock market to rise during the last five trading days of the year and the first two of the new year. Historically, the S&amp;P 500 has gained an average of 1.3% during this seven-day stretch, which began on Christmas Eve and ends on Jan. 3. Since 1950, the market has risen 79% of the time during this period, making it one of the most reliable seasonal patterns. Volume is typically light with many traders away from their desks, so any buying pressure can have an outsized impact on prices, while no major economic data or earnings releases usually allow the market to drift upward on momentum. <br /><br /><strong>Humanoid timeline</strong></p> <p>Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk revealed a more concrete timeline for the Optimus robot this week, stating it would likely be ready for internal use in 2025 and for broader sale by 2026. \"Optimus is going to be the most valuable product ever created,\" Musk declared, despite skepticism from some analysts about the complexity of the technology. The announcement follows a generic pattern of ambitious timelines from the billionaire, but shares of Tesla still rose on the news, contributing to the broader market gains. Meanwhile, competitors in the humanoid robotics space, such as Boston Dynamics and Figure AI, are ramping up their own developments, signaling an intensifying race to bring general-purpose robots to market.<br /><br /><strong>Deal or no deal</strong></p> <p>Paramount Global (PARA) is back in the spotlight after reports surfaced that it was in early talks with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) about a potential merger. The combination would bring together assets like CBS, MTV, and Nickelodeon with CNN, HBO, and Warner Bros. studios, creating a media giant to better compete in the streaming wars against Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS). However, regulatory hurdles would be significant, and debt loads for both companies remain a concern for investors. Shares of both companies saw volatility as the market digested the potential synergies and risks of such a mega-merger.<br /><br /><strong>Crypto calm</strong></p> <p>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered around the $95,000 mark for much of the week, consolidating gains after its recent run-up. The cryptocurrency has seen renewed interest following the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year and improved sentiment toward risk assets. Ethereum (ETH-USD) also held steady, while altcoins saw mixed performance. Industry experts are looking ahead to the upcoming Bitcoin halving event in early 2026 as a potential catalyst for the next major leg up, although regulatory uncertainty continues to loom over the broader crypto ecosystem.</p>",
